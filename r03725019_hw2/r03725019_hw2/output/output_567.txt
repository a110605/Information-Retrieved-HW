The last transmiss anyon heard from Lt Col Lawrenc G Evert s F D Thunderbird wa onli three word long I m hit hard Moment later an American flier on a bomb run over thi small villag saw what he thought wa the explos of an aircraft hit the rice paddi That wa year and dai ago It took until thi year for U S investig to narrow the search for Evert s plane to a site just outsid thi impoverish villag mile northwest of Hanoi the capit and to win approv to dig it up And then in the week just befor Presid Clinton s arriv here on Thursdai the soft acid earth of Tien Chau began give up bit of wire bolt and plastic clearli from an aircraft and final what forens expert believ ar small amount of human remain Thei have not yet been identifi Nonetheless in on of the most emot moment of hi presid Clinton drove on Saturdai into the Vietnames countrysid past water buffalo and a Japanes motorcycl factori and farmer tend their flood field to find the site He hike along a bamboo boardwalk to the place where some older villag still rememb see a plume of smoke after an American fighter wa shot down by anti aircraft fire And he brought with him the down pilot s two son who spent Fridai sift the mud through fine mesh search for the father thei last saw when he flew out of Phoenix on a hot summer dai in When we were and year old David Evert said Saturdai choke back tear as he gestur toward hi older brother Dan we d talk about how we would come to Vietnam and rescu him We kind of feel that we re do that now Clinton s trip across the pock dirt road of thi poverti stricken section of Vietnam wa intend as a vivid demonstr of how a new era ha arriv on in which American and Vietnames work togeth six dai a week finish the muddi and emotion drain busi of account for American still list as miss in action here Stand in mud cover work shoe Clinton on Saturdai call the joint search for remain a come togeth of former enemi that wa unpreced in human histori But like most of Clinton s trip here the somber trek into the paddi wa a remind that piec togeth the Unite State relat with Vietnam is as slow and agon a process as look for the remnant of Lawrenc Evert s fighter Look neither side is ever go to fulli get past it said Pete Peterson the former prison of war who now serv as U S ambassador here Remind of the war ar everywher You drive by them everi dai But we can t chang the past and we can chang the futur and bring the presid here to talk about what we can do togeth I think that open a lot of mind here It is far too earli to tell what will come of Clinton s three dai journei to Vietnam At almost midnight Saturdai he flew into the citi onc known as Saigon the U S headquart for prosecut a fail war that Clinton himself oppos as a young man Despit the late hour thousand of peopl line hi rout for the minut drive from the airport with mani wave as he sped by For all the enthusiasm that hi arriv ha gener among young peopl percent of Vietnames were born after the Communist govern in Hanoi remain deepli suspici of U S intent Engagement sound fine thei all sai as long as it doe not loosen the parti s control of the countri or caus the kind of econom upheav that have level so mani authoritarian regim Indeed Vietnam s Communist Parti chief Le Kha Phieu spoke the languag of old social in a meet with Clinton on Saturdai even and did not respond when the presid suggest that the countri would benefit from more polit freedom a senior U S offici said It wa the more tradit side of Vietnames polit the offici said He did talk about open He did talk about privat entrepreneurship but more clearli in the context of what you would have heard here year ago or year ago After Clinton complet hi offici meet here Saturdai on senior administr offici said Thei know thei won the war but thei ar wonder what went wrong with the peac One kind of engag seem fine to the Hanoi author the kind that is happen out here in the rice paddi of Tien Chau It is without question a remark sight on also on view at five other place around the countri where the Vietnames ar dig for the remain of miss American Score of villag have sign up for job slice awai at the mud beneath the recent drain paddi us a jerri rig devic call a chees cutter Thei have a lot of cut ahead of them Evert s plane is believ to have tunnel a hole at least feet deep With hardli a word pass among them the worker put mud in bucket and pass it along by hand to a wooden platform where dozen of young Vietnames women in purpl raincoat sift through it look for anyth that resembl bone or manufactur part Hundr have been found but few ar larger than the size of a thumb From the site where thei ar ankl deep in muddi water the worker can just make out a long metal railroad bridg that U S forc were try to destroi that night Evert s plane wa the fourth and last in a format and no on know if he drop hi ordnanc But thei know he never pull up to head south and no on saw him eject or notic a parachut open A crew member on a nearbi plane report that the aircraft had been hit on the left rear fuselag by intens anti aircraft fire an imag that seem hard to imagin on Saturdai on the peac paddi where children were laugh and plai on the narrow dirt road and watch the man from America who arriv with roughli car van and buse Just five dai after the crash Evert s fourth child a daughter name Elizabeth wa born Hi widow Wanda rais the four children alon While noth conclus ha been found investig seem quit certain that what thei have trip upon ar the fractur remain of the F D Thi is a chanc for them to take
