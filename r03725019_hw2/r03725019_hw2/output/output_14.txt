Thi is The World a co product of the BBC World Servic PRI and WGBH in Boston I am Lisa Mullin Eight dai after Yugoslav vote for Presid the power struggl in Belgrad is onli intensifi Todai Presid Slobodan Milosev appear on TV to affirm that there will be a second round of elect and to accus hi critic of sell out to the west While Milosev ha the state control media to back him up Vojislav Kostunica seem to have the major of Serb behind him Todai demonstr continu to demand that Milosev step down and Kostunica step up Our coverag begin with the latest from The World s Jennif Glass in Yugoslavia Thi morn opposit support in Belgrad said thei would do whatev it take to make Vojislav Kostunica Presid We ar go to be persist in our demand to prove that Mr Kostunica ha won thi presidenti elect and that we won t give up our demand Well we here ar look at all in the citi I hope that dure the dai we will be look at the whole citi Belgrad and also in Soviet Thei didn t quit do that but demonstr did disrupt traffic in Belgrad and trash collector and public transport worker block street forc commut to walk to work Protest also block the main rail line from the capit to the coast And todai more coal miner join the gener strike Tusca Antasiaovich of Belgrad s Ramiy newspap sai the shutdown of the Colobora mine in particular could provok troubl with the polic The miner thei have respond to the appeal by the alli opposit and began strike And becaus thi mine is veri veri crucial for the electr product the countri we ve heard that signific polic forc mount around the mine still at a safe distanc and still not disturb the miner But appar we mai expect further confront in that area To counter Kostunica s support Milosev is us on of the few weapon still under hi control state run televis Todai he us the medium to address the Serbian peopl and to attack hi oppon At thi moment ahead of the second round of presidenti elect becaus of the doubt that the Democrat opposit of Serbia ha in it abil to achiev a result which it need member of the top Serbian leadership with monei brought into the countri have been bribe blackmail and intimid citizen and ar now organ strike unrest and violenc in order to stop product and all industri activ Nation wa a kei theme as Milosev attack the west for last year s Nato bomb and for what he call Nato s puppet regim in Kosovo Western nation he said ar to blame for unrest in the region Thei do not want peac and prosper in the Balkan Thei want thi to be a zone of constant conflict which would give them an alibi for a perman presenc here A puppet regim guarante violenc potenti mani year of war Thi regim would bring anyth but peac Only our polici guarante peac That could be a veil threat that if Milosev lose he will fight with whatev forc he can still command The speech could also be lai the groundwork for Presid Milosev to declar a state of Emergenc anoth wai he could hold on to power For The World I m Jennif Glass in Podgorica Yugoslavia Meanwhil Russia todai resist Western pressur to get Milosev to conced defeat Vladimir Putin said he is will to receiv Milosev and Kostunica in Moscow to quot discuss wai of resolv the situat But then the Russian Presid took off for a four dai visit to India suggest no meet is like befor the run off vote The World s Nenad Chebeck is in Moscow now How do you read the signal from Moscow Nenad One the on hand we have heard statement prior to todai with Moscow recogn Kostunica as the right Presid and now we ar hear more critic statement What do you read them as Well judg by what we heard Putin said that he want to see the two candid for the second round of elect So in an obliqu wai Putin ha actual not taken Milosev s side but he ha sort of recogn the fact that there will be a second round of elect for the Presid of Yugoslavia which is far from what either of the Serbian opposit leader want to hear or from what the Western leader want to hear Thei want to hear explicit support from Moscow for Kostunica that s not come The question is why it is not come And I wonder if you can call on some of your year of report out of Belgrad as well includ dure the NATO bomb At that time of cours we heard that line that Russia and Serbia ar tradit alli But I wonder if that ha chang and we ar see the evid of that chang now Well Russia and Serbia do have some histor ti Thei have the same common orthodox faith But Russia ha never in ani decis moment actual stood by Serbia and help it So in a wai although these tradit ti ar there Russia ha never actual risk it reput or it stand to stand by Milosev s side or by the side of Serbia as a state So then why is it import who Moscow support in thi elect Well it s veri import becaus Russia is seen as a decis factor who could sort of possibl try and mediat in thi crisi and somehow persuad Milosev to leav But Russia is try to sort of back off and not take a veri decis stand for a coupl of reason First of all it doe want to be an import player on on side but on the other hand it s got to offer someth to Milosev if it want to sort of us him to sort of step down The West is not help by insist on a War Crime trial for Milosev So Russia sort of need to look carefulli at sort of what it can actual offer to Milosev some kind of a carrot And there is no carrot which seem to be on the plate at the moment There is inde pressur come from Washington Can you tell us about some of the high level contact that s been made between Washington and Moscow Well last weekend Presid Clinton phone Russia s Presid Vladimir Putin and thei spoke about the crisi in Yugoslavia From what we hear from the White Hous Presid Clinton wa veri anxiou to hear some veri decis word of support for Kostunica and inde in that convers Presid Putin did sort of take that kind of a line But todai s statement befor he left for India by Presid Putin definit is not what Washington wa anxiou to hear Do we know what Moscow make of Milosev and what it think of Kostunica the oppon Moscow is take a sort of wait and see kind of an attitud On the on hand it doe recogn that Milosev is a man of the past For exampl we had last night the Head of the power Russian Secur Council who said that Belgrad need a Presid who is recogn by the world but certainli not Milosev On the other hand what Russia fear is that whilst with Milosev it doe have some leverag if Kostunica came into power thei might see the same kind of thing that thei have seen in Hungari in Poland in the Czech Republ in all the other Eastern block countri who onc thei ve freed themselv from Russian control have taken a decis pro western attitud and inde some of them have becom member of NATO Russia feel as if Yugoslavia it sort of almost onli alli it s got in that part of Europ and it feel that it ha more leverag over Milosev than it might have over Kostunica I don t think thei ll be sorri to see Milosev go but at thi stage thei ar still not prepar to put their weight behind ani on of the two candid Speak to us from Moscow The World s Nenad Chebeck
