the democrat opposit of Serbia hi parti coalit price to consolid it power The Serbian peopl toppl Slobodan Milosev s govern ten dai ago when thei took to the street to protest an attempt to nullifi the result of the Septemb th presidenti elect In Kosovo the major Albanian popul who seek independ from Serbia refus to particip in the elect and thei have voic mix reaction to the event of the past three week Todai s Datelin examin the subject of Kosovo in Yugoslavia s new govern Here is Judith Latham Balkan analyst sai the question of the futur relationship between Kosovo and the new govern in Belgrad is exceedingli complex Although Kosovo s Serb particip in the Yugoslav presidenti elect the major Albanian popul of Kosovo boycot them and there ar even report that mani Kosovo Albanian secretli hope Mr Milosev would win Becaus so long as an indit war crimin wa Presid of Yugoslavia thei thought the intern commun might be more favor dispos to an independ Kosovo some dai Despit Mr Kostunica s reput as a strong Serb nationalist he is gener regard as a democrat and is far more reason than hi predecessor Greg Sholti is Senior Director for Southeast European affair at the Nation Secur Council in Washington He sai Mr Kostunica s public statement thu far have been encourag With respect to Kosovo he made a statement where he recogn the commit that Yugoslavia ha taken with respect to Kosovo and I think our conclus is that in the long run have democrat reform in Belgrad is to the benefit of the peopl of Kosovo And we re go to work with the peopl of Kosovo to build up democraci there to help them recov from the terribl campaign of ethnic cleans that took place there and to help them build up institut for a democrat self govern Greg Sholti staff member of the Nation Secur Council Jim Hooper is Director of the Washington offic of the Internat Crise Group which is headquart in Brussel I talk with Mr Hooper about the new Yugoslav Presid s view on Kosovo On October the th Mr Kostunica spoke with two report from The Washington Post and he express a fatalist view about the futur statu of Kosovo and said We can imagin even Kosovo not be part of Serbia and we can imagin Kosovo be part of Serbia although not right now becaus of NATO s occup And what kind of accommod might be possibl He is veri eager for exampl for Serb to be abl to go back to Kosovo and live there in safeti Well I think it s a legitim concern to be worri about Kosovo Serb and in The Washington Post interview I believ Mr Kostunica refer to hi think about releas some of the Kosovo Albanian there ar almost a thousand of them held in Serbian jail who were taken there at the end of the NATO bomb to get them out of Kosovo and that thei have been polit prison sinc then I think thi would be a veri welcom gestur by the Kosovo Albanian if he did that What he is ask howev is that the author in Kosovo do provid inform on miss Serb The realiti of cours is that the Kosovo Albanian cannot imagin Kosovo be anywai a part of Serbia or a part of the Feder Republ of Yugoslavia You know there were a number of report that quit a few Kosovo Albanian were not entir thrill with the defeat of Mr Milosev becaus that seem in some wai to weaken their case for independ particularli with the intern commun How do you see the respons of the intern commun and particularli the Unite State to the Kosovor quest for independ given a more democrat govern in Belgrad I think the Kosovo Albanian ar veri concern about the intern commun respons to the unfold event in Serbia As long as Mr Milosev wa there no on in the West would even consid it that Kosovo might return to Serbia or the FRY whether it wa rule by Milosev would be gone With the Democrat in power their concern is that the support for their independ among the West is go to diminish and the intern commun will begin urg that thei take a fresh look at the idea of possibl link up to Serbia or the FRY The departur of Milosev wa good new for everyon in the region except the Kosovar at least that s how mani Kosovo Albanian feel Jim Hooper Director of the Washington offic of the Internat Crise Group Loui Cell Head of ICG s offic in Pristina sai it s far better for Kosovo the Balkan and the world as a whole that Slobodan Milosev is no longer in power in Serbian It s obvious go to be easier over the long run to achiev a peac and a stabl solut in Kosovo and the Balkan without Milosev there Kostunica a democrat elect leader of Serbia is quit properli be includ in intern deliber The Kosovo Albanian on the other hand don t have their own govern as thei ar under a UN protector but there is no on with ani legitimaci now in the ey of the Kosovo Albanian who can repres their interest at least on matter of their futur On Kosovo Kostunica ha clearli express strong view He believ that Kosovo it is part of Serbia that Serbian author should return and at the most the Kosovo can expect for it futur is the substanti economi All of those thing ar utterli anathema and complet unaccept to Kosovo Albanian Mr Cell sai Mr Kostunica s victori ha forc the Kosovo Albanian to come to grip with their own lack of polit power That is none of their leader neither Ibrahim Rugova nor Hashim Thaci ha legitimaci in the ey of the world So it is essenti that the Albanian creat interim government institut in Kosovo befor discuss their futur statu with Belgrad He sai the Albanian commun would be well advis to get it act togeth in term of a leadership council after local elect schedul for October th On the other hand he sai the Serb of Kosovo have been hearten by Mr Kostunica s victori becaus thei think there is a real chanc what thei regard as intern occup by the Unite Nation will end and Serb forc will then return to Kosovo Loui Cell spoke with us by mobil phone from Pristina where he ha been monitor recent event Elier Jarcob Presid of the Nation Albanian American Council sai he is concern that recent develop in Yugoslavia will shift intern attent and develop aid to the new govern in Belgrad I think for Albanian in Kosovo the chang in Serbia will make thing much more complic Eventual there will need to be some sort of discuss between Albanian in Kosovo and Serb in Belgrad about a rang of issu includ the fate of polit prison in Serbia restitut to Kosovo for crime commit there what happen with war crimin who ar roam freeli
