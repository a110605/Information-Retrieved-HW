line the road lead from the Univers Thi year old student said she didn t care what Mr Clinton said about human right as long as increas US invest brought more job for peopl like her I just care about the busi and economi and I don t care about polit I hope that Presid Clinton s visit to Vietnam will provid an opportun for entrepreneur in Vietnam to come to contact with American entrepreneur and more job will be creat But whatev peopl in Vietnam think critic back in the Unite State will have some more ammunit todai even though the State depart show the interpret when hi speech wa broadcast on

veri much for join us Obviousli your emot ar veri complic on a dai like todai I wonder if you could sort them out a littl bit for us Ye I mean I have felt so emot these dai and a bit complic as you can see On on hand you know I wa excit about the visit of Mr Clinton the first US presid to Vietnam sinc the war But at the same time hi visit bring me back to the hardship that I us to have dure the Vietnam war I wa in Hanoi dure the heaviest air strike by the Air Forc of the Unite State I wa with my grandmom becaus my parent thei all were correspond and I wa too littl to understand at that time about death and life But oh I rememb so vividli in my life that you know through the night we had to hide ourselv in a shelter veri tini on and through the night my grandmoth she wa sit outsid of the shelter just becaus you know no more space for her And I don t know all I rememb I wa so worri about mayb my grandmom would die and that s why you know when Mr Clinton visit the countri I have mix emot But on the other hand you know I am glad that now the relationship between two countri is get better and better You becam a journalist as your mother wa Is that partli why you chose the career that you did I think I would like to follow my mother s and my father s footstep and that s why I have chosen to be a journalist My dad wasn t happi at all he thought that for a femal be a journalist realli realli difficult I told him that why you know I like that job I wonder about anoth differ I am think about the job that your mother might have been do as a journalist in Vietnam as a North Vietnames journalist dure the war To some extent she must have been under certain pressur to report a stori a certain wai certainli a wai that the North Vietnames govern would approv Here you ar a journalist in a differ gener and a differ era Do you see a big differ between the job that you ar do and the job that mayb your mother did and di do Of cours you know I did see a big differ and that s when I have great empathi to my mom s job I mean she wa print journalist for the Northern govern dure the war and you know she left a diari she wrote dure her dai of the war She couldn t report what she saw becaus you know if propaganda becaus you know if you report someth like neg mayb Vietnames peopl can think that oh we re lose the war and she could onli report about hero of the war But dure her real diari I have seen mani mani thing that she wa suffer like you know even hunger and even the discuss between the soldier and you know thei kill each other by mistak If you were abl to talk to her now and tell her what ha happen sinc she di and what ha happen as a result of the war in whose servic like million Vietnames she di What would you tell her Actualli I have never thought of thi question but if I would have had a chanc to talk to her now I would sai that you know now what she invest in her life and in her job now you know it bring some posit result I think so for her own daughter and for the other peopl You know I miss her veri much and I wish she could be here with me work in a much much freer environ The war is still veri aliv for you as an emot experi and ha veri vivid memori and you ar still a young person Yet there ar mani peopl in Vietnam who ar younger still who weren t even born dure what we call the Vietnam war and your countrymen call the American war I wonder if you could speak a littl bit about those peopl for them who have had no direct experi the major in fact of the popul of your countri Is the war the same ongo issu No I don t think so Actualli for the young gener of Vietnam todai you know for them now it s onli the futur in front of them and thei think Oh America is the land full of opportun of technolog And thei even don t want to talk about the war so thei have a complet differ experi from what I am have But howev I am veri glad to see that you know peopl now thei don t have to think of the war And thei you know when peopl ask them where do you want to go after your Univers or where do you want to go to develop your career I think on of the countri thei would includ in their answer is the Unite State Huang Li is a produc with
