At the White Hous todai Presid Clinton said the Serb quot ar try to get their countri back and that American hope thei do The opposit candid who accord to all unbias report clearli won the elect obvious ha also ha strong differ with us Thi is not a question of whether he agre with us All we want for the Serbian peopl is what we want for peopl everywher the right to freeli choos their own leader That s Presid Clinton speak earlier todai at the White Hous Alexa Gelu is a public polici scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington DC Mr Gelu you ar a Serb historian I wonder if you can shed some light on what s happen for us Do you believ that what we ar see todai is a revolut It s not a revolut in the sens that there is no violenc But it is revolut in the sens that larg mass of peopl seem to be firmli determin to overthrow and chang the regim and that Serbia deep in hi heart ha decid that thei want to have democrat societi So what s the strategi as you see it at work Why ar the protest attack the parliament build I mean why ar thei confront the Presid I think it is symbol you know thei ar attack you know seat of power and so on I mean thei ar not attack parliament becaus thei ar oppos to parliamentarian on the contrari you know thei want democraci I mean thei ar symbol gestur Thei ar throw for exampl Milosev pictur out of the parliament Thei know where the Presid is presum Why aren t thei go to see him at hi offici resid or at the palac Well you see first of all it is not veri like that at the moment he is in that palac or resid He is probabl in some secret bunker where he wa for exampl dure the NATO bomb And secondli Milosev live in a residenti area right with rather narrow street and remov from the center of Belgrad So it s not so easi to get there you know It is rel easi for polic to block the access either to hi privat hous or to hi resid I think thi is the main reason If he live in the center of Belgrad I am certain that thei would be storm hi hous Do you think the Serb have it in their mind to see that Milosev get out unharm Do you think that there is a possibl that thei have in mind Chouchescu type fire squad into thi Well I would guess that thi moment when peopl ar realli veri angri there ar some peopl who would wish for Milosev and hi follow the fate of Chouchescu the Romanian dictat and hi wife but major of peopl would be against it you see The opposit is in gener is adam that thei ar against violenc that thei ar against reveng against kill and so on And also if you look at Milosev s year of rule in Serbia I mean he repress media He intimid polit oppon bribe them He often did not respect law But he had not engag in larg scale violenc or repress insid Serbia itself also over Bosnia and Croatia these ar differ question So in that sens I don t think I would not think that major of Serb would want Milosev kill How doe Milosev get out of thi Well with some difficulti I think the wai for Milosev now is simpli to accept the defeat and in return to demand from the opposit that he is not persecut nor extradit to The Hagu and simpli withdraw to privat life I don t think there is ani other solut for him at the moment Well of cours nobodi know exactli what he is think right now but is he the type of leader base on some of hi past action to think that he can withstand even thi kind of feverish opposit One of hi kind of qualiti if you can call it a qualiti he ha veri strong nerv so it is difficult to spook him and he can remain under great pressur for a long time We wit that dure NATO bomb but at the same time he is how shall I put it mai be hi strategi is irrat right Hi whole view of polit is in deep conflict with the valu of modern democraci But at the same time on a dai to dai basi he is not an irrat politician He is a ration pragmat politician who calcul who tri to a find a wai out and so on He is not a mad man as some peopl see him right and so I think that ultim these instinct of self preserv and ration calcul will prevail Alexa Gelu is a public polici scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington DC Thank you veri much Thank you
