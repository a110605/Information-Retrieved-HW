While the Internat relief effort and some miracul recoveri continu in earthquak ravag western India some ar begin to question just how so much structur destruct wa possibl Much of the most devast area near the epicent of Fridai s killer quak includ lower level build accord to some could have been more carefulli construct But the huge build boom in a region dure the earli s appar made close qualiti control difficult Vikram Prakash is a Professor of Architectur at the Univers of Washington in Seattl He visit the region last year on a teach tour He becam familiar with the local construct Professor Prakash tell us about on of the main fault in local construct A lot of these build were made veri quickli with seriou stress on time and We were look at some of the unfinish build and it seem about the construct wa at least for our you know US train ey significantli sub standard Most of that would relat to how the steel in the build insid the concret is join togeth And mostli I felt that s fine but I would suspect that most of the collaps absolut catastroph collaps in the build that have taken place ar mostli due to the manner in which the steel ha been join togeth with other part of the build That lead me to ask about why were there not stricter build code enforc at the time if commun like Ahmedabad were known to be in an earthquak risk area Well what happen is that the build code ar pretti stringent and thei ar veri clear about the earthquak code But particularli in a situat where there is a lot of rapid build most of the actual construct is done by larg wave of immigr labor that come in to simpli do the work It s all veri rudimentari simpl hand carri concret poor construct So in those circumst you know it s the privat develop who ar realli respons to make sure that all the steel is properli pour it s properli laid out and properli joint togeth And you know I m not sai that thei didn t properli supervis but what I m also sai is that there is no natur expertis built into the workforc so that some of the care attent that need to be paid to the process of joint the steel probabl wa just not present in the everydai technolog of the peopl who ar do the work As incred sad as thi disast is for the futur of commun like Ahmedabad what lesson is it give for it futur as there ar enorm attempt to rebuild the commun What is go to actual happen in term of the enforc of the build code is if on can hope that it will be better But possibl some other thing that might be put into place more easili might be if we talk about the destruct that s taken place in the more you know smaller construct closer to the epicent Just simpler techniqu of bind wall brick wall construct like make sure the brick is you know overlap I think these ar sort of simpl technolog that on can hope to dissemin amongst the peopl who ar go to essenti rebuild their own hous and hope that the technolog and hope that just the awar level is transform a littl bit so that thei can do a better job I mean the builder you know ar probabl hopefulli you know there s some kind of legal reinforc for them in the citi But I think a lot of the NGO activist in the rural area where most of the reconstruct is probabl go to happen with the peopl do the work themselv ar try to and hopefulli will be success in dissemin some simpl techniqu that can significantli improv their abil to well not stand up in a earthquak but to sort of prevent catastroph damag Vikram Prakash is a Professor of Architectur at the Univers of Washington in Seattl
