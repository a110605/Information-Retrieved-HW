tonight mr woolsei i d like to start you off where you d like to begin on thi perhap the threat of terror in yemen perhap the claim of respons tonight yemen is a lawless place and most ani of the group that andrea mitchel talk about could have been involv but there s anoth that we ought to consid which is the possibl that there is some govern activ behind thi for exampl from iraq the lead f b i agent now unfortun deceas in new york citi for the world trade center investig who ran the investig up there alwai thought that saddam hussein wa behind the world trade center oper and so there s a real propens for terrorist group or govern behind terrorist oper to run so call fals flag oper where there s decept as to who is involv and i think we need to keep an open mind thi mai be on of these quasi independ terrorist organ but conceiv there could be a govern back there somewher mr woolsei i don t know how much wa spent on u s intellig last year i know it s a lot of monei and i know a lot of that monei wa spent in the region we re talk about here tonight how good ar the unit state contact how much do we know obvious in thi case not to be flip not enough well certainli not enough to have stop thi and that s a great tragedi especi for those who lost their live with famili american intellig in the mideast on the whole is pretti good much of it deriv from close work relationship with friendli intellig servic in the area and friendli state some of the most high tech intellig is not directli relev to someth like thi for exampl photo reconnaiss satellit or mani type of commun intercept and those ar the realli expens part of american intellig penetr terrorist group it kind of come down to have spi and that s hard and veri difficult work in the region and to the veri nitti gritti busi of track a case ani case it s awfulli nice when you can get someon veri basic at the street level to tell how often doe that happen in that region it happen from time to time but the c i a ha oper for a few year under some restrict some guidelin that discourag thei don t prevent but thei do discourag the recruit insid terrorist organ of peopl for exampl who mai have been guilti of human right violat in the past well you know if you re recruit someon insid a govern often you get a good person insid a bad govern that s will to work for the unit state becaus thei re had sympathet with democraci but if you re talk about be insid a terrorist group the onli peopl in there ar terrorist so you re go to have to pai monei or otherwis do someth to get inform from some pretti unsavori peopl if you want to be success do you agre that it doesn t too long month year of easi militari oper in the red sea through the canal to breed complac no matter what the terrorist threat mai be it s possibl but i wa onc undersecretari of the navi and listen to what wa go on here thei were onli go to be in port for four hour sailor were arm and stand there readi to shoot if someth suspici happen but thi wa a tug appar that wa part of the dock oper for the fuel and it would have been veri veri difficult even with good intellig and even with veri alert peopl to have stop someth like thi former director of central intellig jame woolsei thank you veri much for be with us tonight
