address the confer of the Asia Pacif Econom Co oper Forum Hi subject global You have felt both it great benefit and it temporari but brutal sting On balanc the global economi and more open market clearli have been a posit forc in Asia and inde around the world Tomorrow Presid Clinton will fly to a countri he intend to cite as an exampl of the posit forc of more open market Vietnam Vietnames leader hope global will revers the countri s high tech brain drain to the west The World s Odlone Cussin report from Hanoi Almost everyon seem to be studi English and mani prepar for foreign univers entranc exam Almost Vietnames studi in the US in the school year increas from the year befor and that number continu to grow Bill Clinton will not ignor Vietnam s student dure hi visit He will give a speech at Hanoi s Nation Univers a speech that is expect to be broadcast live Young peopl in Vietnam ar especi need in the so call knowledg economi In the offic of FPT a fast grow Internet servic provid in Hanoi the averag ag of the employe is a mere FPT s deputi director Chu Than Ha herself year old sai anyon with the monei to go abroad doe I think for young peopl in Vietnam now we want to learn to get experi from foreign countri as a student If thei have the tradit for exampl if the parent have monei to support them to go to other countri like Australia US after that come back to Vietnam and to work Other don t feel the urgenc to leav though year old Wen Tu Cha who work at FPT as an e commerc develop sai govern restrict on the Internet and new make her job more difficult She sai mani of her classmat simpli chose to leav mostli for the Unite State But Wen sai she is stai at least for now Mani mani of my friend think that we should go abroad and then stai there becaus thei have more liberti thei have more facil and equip to develop yourself but I don t think so Mayb you think that work condit in Vietnam is not as good as in the Unite State but if you can improv it yourself you d feel more happi Accord to a govern plan announc thi year Vietnam need to have softwar engin by but there ar onli about todai Could explain low govern invest for the problem the univers just don t get enough monei to keep up to date on inform technolog Indeed that is precis why Wen s friend ar leav At anoth hi tech compani CMC Comput the benefit of go abroad appear clear Ha The Minh is the director of the compani which ha employe and an annual growth of You cannot prevent it Thei ar go to west and mai be the environ in the west is much better Thei mai stai there for a few year let s sai year year and in the nice dai thei should come back and that peopl will be like the kei leader to creat the new busi in Vietnam But Ha conced he could onli start hi compani becaus he first spent year work in a Vietnames govern ministri He sai infrastructur and educ problem still plagu Vietnam and not mani of the young peopl who go abroad now ar come back For the sake of hi busi Ha sai he hope Presid Clinton s visit and increas US invest in Vietnam will help chang that soon For The World thi is Odlon Cussin in Hanoi Presid Clinton s visit probabl won t chang Vietnam s economi as much as a bilater trade pact will David Dapist chief economist for the Vietnam project at Harvard Univers s Kennedi school of govern sai that onc that agreement is ratifi it will rectifi what the Vietnames current consid an unfair trade relationship Right now it is legal to trade but on manufactur good particularli the US impos veri high tariff The result of the bilater trade agreement would be to treat Vietnam like everi other countri includ China and allow their good to come in on an equal basi And after the Congress approv the pact trade between the two countri will increas both wai but especi Vietnam will find it much easier to export their manufactur good What is the symbol signific of the Presid of the Unite State go to Vietnam in term of the impact it realli is go to have in continu relat and trade relat between the US and Vietnam Is he there just to show up or is he actual go to be abl to do some busi I don t think he will do busi in the normal sens of negoti more thing That part ha been done I think it is symbol in the sens that he is sai we would like to start a new chapter that we ar no longer try to undermin the govern as mani fear Presid Clinton s visit will be success if he can lai to rest some of those fear and let them realiz that the develop of their economi and societi will occur not becaus we ar plan or plot it but simpli becaus of the natur process that all countri go through Give us if you can just a quick kind of pictur of the economi of Vietnam Is Vietnam in a sens a unifi countri now Econom polit doe it have on basic set of problem or ar thei region The South is the econom powerhous The competit industri most of the export the rice bowl the oil all come from the south The North ha the polit power it ha rather ineffici import substitut heavi industri that need tariff subsidi and so on I think on reason that thei ar go so slow on reform is that the North is afraid that further reform would further strengthen the South and that upset the polit balanc such as it is and that is on of sever thing that thei ar nervou about What about the Vietnames themselv What is it about them that you find especi impress Well asid from the fact that thei often win prize in the Math Olympic and that is not true of everi countri I think on littl stori will get the idea across of just how much promis the countri ha If you go down to Ho Ching Ming Citi you will find a kind of French pastri restaur shop that is kind of upscal and the owner that I know had hire a French pastri chef train in Pari and he made excel pastri And after or month he found a Vietnames woman he decid to marri move back to Franc and made the announc rather suddenli My friend wa at a loss for what to do until the guard who watch the shop at night went to him and said I will do the pastri He had been watch the gui at in the morn when he came in and had learn himself how to make pastri and without miss a beat thei were abl to turn out excel French pastri becaus the Vietnames guard had learn on hi own how to do what take month or year of train in mani other situat The countri ha immens promis and if the rule ar set so that peopl ar allow to work it would do veri veri well David Dapist is Chief Economist at the Vietnam program at Harvard Univers s Kennedi School of Govern Thank again Thank you It ha been a pleasur
