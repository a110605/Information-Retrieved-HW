Thei call it the DD destroy an electr power stealth ship design to attack enemi hundr of mile inland from ani of the world s ocean as well as fight at sea It will carri more Tomahawk cruis missil and bigger gun than ani destroy in exist yet will need fewer than a third as mani sailor and cost less to oper sai it advoc who includ the secretari of the Navi Richard Danzig and lead member of Congress It s like go from sail to steam assert Kendel Peas a vice presid of Gener Dynam and a former rear admir Gener Dynam will releas it first public diagram of the DD at a Navi confer thi week Yet for all the hoopla over it the DD face a gantlet of obstacl emblemat of the broader problem that the arm servic and the administr of Presid elect Georg W Bush will confront as thei struggl to balanc modern the militari with pai for the upkeep of the ag equip thei have now Dure the campaign Bush hammer home the need to rebuild the servic call for an acquisit program that would propel America gener ahead in militari technolog To it advoc DD fit that goal and Bush is on record as promot an earlier version of the DD known as the arsen ship But Bush also never explain how he would pai for such leap ahead technolog and therein li the rub Like the other servic the Navi is struggl just to pai for mundan thing like fuel spare part and paint And long befor it can expect to sail it first DD in the Navi sai it must replac ag plane and rust ship that ar schedul for retir in the come decad The Congression Budget Office ha predict that the Pentagon budget will have to grow by as much as billion a year to maintain weapon system while move ahead with new on like the DD Some senior Pentagon offici sai the shortfal is well over billion a year Yet Bush ha call for increas militari spend by just billion over the next decad That mean that Bush s choic for secretari of defens Donald H Rumsfeld will almost sure have to cancel or postpon major program in develop defens analyst sai High on that list of potenti victim ar the Air Forc s F fighter the most expens jet in histori cost as much as million each the Marin Corp V Osprei tilt rotor aircraft at as much as million each and the DD at million each Important decis on the F a stealth fighter for air to air combat could be made as soon as thi week when a Pentagon panel is schedul to decid whether to allow the plane to go into product Though an outright cancel of the program seem unlik a choru of F critic in and outsid the Pentagon ar call for a postpon or cutback in the program which ha been plagu by product delai and cost overrun Adviser to Bush have also said thei plan to review all of the Pentagon s fighter plane program thi spring The Marin Corp V Osprei is also in some peril have suffer two fatal crash last year The depart secretari of defens William S Cohen ha call for an independ review of the program which wa almost cancel year ago by Dick Chenei who wa secretari of defens then and ha return to Washington as the vice presid elect But the DD is arguabl the most endang of the big ticket program becaus it is the furthest from be develop While actual V s and F s ar alreadi fly the DD with it radar deflect hull and futurist electr propuls system exist mainli on draw board at the Bath Iron Work in Main own by Gener Dynam and Ingall Shipbuild s yard in Pascagoula Miss own by Litton Industri The two shipbuild ar head compet consortium seek to design the ship Under current Navi plan a contract for the program would be issu thi spring call for the first DD keel to be laid in and the first complet ship to enter the fleet in The Navi want to build vessel to replac it Spruanc class destroy The long lead time will give the destroy s critic and thei ar mani time to postpon or kill the program There ar academ who argu that the Navi should build a fleet of small inexpens street fighter ship capabl of oper close to shore in mine infest water and fend off attack from low tech enemi like the terrorist who nearli sank the destroy Cole in Yemen last October Other contend that the Navi could save monei by shelv the DD and simpli refit four Trident nuclear submarin schedul for retir with Tomahawk missil instead And critic of Pentagon spend rais question about the need for a new class of power destroy when the Unite State face no superpow rival on the high sea That monei might be better spent on diplomaci than weapon some contend It feel to me like the Navi is still feel around for a mission when thei realli don t have an enemi to face said Eugen Carrol a retir rear admir who is vice presid of the Center for Defens Informat a nonprofit Pentagon watchdog group But what the program ha go for it is the support of two import Republican senat Trent Lott of Mississippi where half of the DD s would be built and John W Warner of Virginia With Bush s inaugur Lott will resum hi duti as Senat major leader and Warner will continu as chairman of the Senat Armed Servic Committe There is also wide agreement that the Navi must remak itself to meet the new if less clear challeng of the post Soviet era And mani militari expert sai that mission must focu not on the blue sea but on the green water closer to shore In the wake of the end of the Cold War we recogn that the big naval battl on the open sea ar not like said Danzig who will leav hi post as Navi secretari thi month The more relev issu is to be abl to project fire power from the sea to the shore DD would be the first destroy design specif to perform that mission The DD would serv that mission in sever wai it defend sai First it would be stealthier Propel by electr engin it would be quieter than exist ship It would also have a narrow invert V hull design to avoid detect by radar or sonar Second it would carri far more firepow than exist destroy haul at least cruis missil and foot long bullet for it two foot long gun Those gun would be abl to hit target mile inland four time as far as gun on most destroy And with it more effici electr propuls system it would be abl to stai at sea longer without refuel The Navi also want the ship design to oper with a crew of just instead of the sailor aboard exist destroy The sharp reduct would be made possibl by sever innov Electric drive would mean fewer move part and less mainten rust resist paint would requir less scrape and repaint meal prepar in advanc would end the need for squad of potato peeler and soup stirrer With it lower fuel cost and smaller crew each DD would save the Navi million a year Danzig contend The smaller crew would also help the Navi with it recruit problem So would the fact that the ship with smaller engin and larger hull would give sailor more spaciou live quarter with six bed stateroom rather than cramp bed bunkroom But all that sound too good to be true critic of the program contend More import Danzig a lead champion of the program will soon be out of offic make the ship even more vulner some Navi offici sai Danzig insist the program will be sustain If test prove that the ship can do what it is design to do it will be quit appar that thi is just a good idea he said
