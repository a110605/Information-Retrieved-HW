Thank you John I am Toni Rigg bring you thi hour of VOA New Now Ten year ago todai Presid Georg Bush inform the American peopl that the Gulf War had begun At the Pentagon Defens Secretari Dick Chenei and Gener Colin Powel describ the first wave of air attack on Iraqi forc Less than six week later the alli launch a four dai ground offens that liber Kuwait and forc Baghdad to accept strict sanction and weapon inspect Now on decad later Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein remain in power present a challeng for incom Presid Georg W Bush along with Vice Presid Chenei and Secretari of State Design Powel On thi addit of Datelin we look at old foe and new challeng US polici toward Iraq here s Dave Arlington Accord to veteran Iraq analyst Lauri Milroi Saddam Hussein will be look to get the better of Georg W Bush the son of the man who claim to have vest him Saddam is a veng charact for whom the Gulf War never ever end In essenc it is a rematch and Ms Milroi sai the new man in the White Hous must do what hi father fail to remov Saddam Hussein from power She sai step on would be to arm Iraqi opposit group The idea would be to replic what the Kurd did in the North after the Gulf War Thei liber their territori to do that in the rest of Iraq perhap protect by no fly zone or even the support of the US Air Forc obliter that territori from the outsid so Saddam becom noth but the Mayor of Baghdad and then the regim collaps New report sai Presid Clinton last week approv a plan to have the Iraqi opposit distribut humanitarian aid and propaganda within Northern Iraq But he ha never fulli implement the so call Iraq Liber Act pass by Congress in which author million dollar in arm and militari train for Iraqi rebel Judith Kipper a Middl East expert associ with the Council on Foreign Relat and the Senat for Strateg and Internat Studi sai the act consist more of word than action She sai the opposit group should be support becaus thei repres a differ vision of Iraq s futur But in her view thei do not have enough cohes to mount ani kind of effect militari campaign It s nice to talk about it peopl get grand idea big illus sit in Washington DC but what is possibl to do on the ground is quit differ But what some lead Republican sai implement of the Iraq Liber Act mean is militari support for these rebel group Well so far nobodi s given them ani militari support and I can t imagin that the next administr s go to do it either becaus there s no on to give it to Judith Kipper advis the incom administr to assess whether UN sanction still provid the best wai for contain Iraq militarili as support for the sanction dwindl even among US alli For some of the other countri that would like to do busi in Iraq who Iraq ow huge debt to some of the UN Secur Council member and who have a differ view that sanction haven t work ten year is enough and so it s time to end them There ar genuin differ among the countri even though the Unite State mai want to continu sanction if it partner in the UN Secur Council ar not will to do that there ha to be an accommod Secretari of State design Colin Powel sai he want to reenerg the sanction and analyst Charl Dopher sai it mai be possibl to get US alli and the Secur Council to focu on the long term threat from Iraq instead of short term gain thei mai deriv from an eas of sanction Mr Dopher serv for seven year as the second in command at the UN Special Commiss on Iraq He told me that the incom Bush administr mayb much more forc in deal with Iraq and with US alli You know the Unite State ha work larg with alli on the Iraq question larg through the Secur Council Mani of these member of the Secur Council have argu that the current regim is inevit that it is onli a matter of pragmat which caus them to have to work with them The incom administr is go to have to decid whether that in fact is the best that can be achiev Bear in mind you know thi regim ha a track record which is abomin Thei ve invad countri thei treat their own popul with no respect thei ve us weapon of mass destruct against their own popul Do you want and can you accept over the long term thi type of decis make apparatu over weapon of mass destruct convent forc and a signific portion of the world s oil market We deploi a lot of forc in the region we keep thi regim contain within limit militarili and that cost us lot of monei I think a lot of our alli ar get a free ride here Are we go to allow them to sai that in effect thi regim is legitim and bear in mind thei have a stake in preserv the current regim under the current circumst and thei re make monei off it the current regim I am not in a posit to understand fulli the type of militari commit which would be requir to replac it militarili but I think that s certainli someth which ha to be more fulli explor Hopefulli other option can becom more tenabl but it s go to requir a stronger commit on the part of some of our friend and alli to particip So would you sai on big chang from ten year ago is that there is no Gulf War coalit I certainli think that the coalit which wa form to expel Iraq from Kuwait ha disintegr The unifi principl there wa veri clear it s much more difficult to get a coalit built around a potenti risk You sai that Saddam Hussein ha militari and econom aim that would give Iraq weapon of mass destruct and domin within OPEC how far along is he Well I think he s pretti far along in the weapon of mass destruct He ha the capabl he ha a pool of scientist and engin who have demonstr thei can build these weapon When we were oper we were not abl to account for all of them he s had now two year to reconstitut these effort in an even stronger wai From their perspect thei look at weapon and oil and econom tool all as part of a continu of power and influenc Their object I believ is to displac the Saudi as sort of a kei member of OPEC You sai that the attempt by the Secur Council to disarm Iraq of it weapon of mass destruct wa doom from the begin Why do you sai that I make a comparison with the disarma vision of the treati after the First World War where the Alli had veri stringent disarma provis which would be enforc on Germani And what wa found then and what wa found I think in the case of Iraq is that you re ask the countri to get rid of someth which it leadership think is absolut vital to it nation secur and yet you re empow an intern bodi with onli basic camera and pencil And so while even in the case of Iraq there were stringent econom sanction impos on them still thei were will to pai a veri larg price to conceal weapon and we were given no author other than the back of a veri loos coalit to enforc that Basic what the Iraqi were sai is there re limit to what you can do becaus you mean the coalit didn t occupi Iraq and thei re quit right about that Tariq Aziz would look at us and me in particular and sai you re not the McArthur you can t expect us to do all these thing Until last April Charl Dopher wa Deputi Chairman of UNSCOM the UN Special Commiss on Iraq A review of US polici toward Iraq mai have to be put on hold if the situat between Israel and the Palestinian becom even more unstabl And even there Saddam Hussein mai plai a role He s been ask Iraqi to come forward to prepar for a holi war against Israel and claim more than six and a half million volunt As the Iraqi leader champion the Palestinian caus Charl Dopher sai he mai also make it harder for the Unite State to find support in the Arab world But anoth analyst sai Iraq threaten the Unite State more directli In her new book titl Studi Of Reveng Saddam Hussein s Unfinish War Against America Lauri Milroi sai the Unite State and it Alli ar ignor evid that the Iraqi leader wa behind the bomb of New York s World Trade Center and other terrorist attack attempt against US interest Thei don t see that Iraq is work with Muslim extremist includ Osama Bin Laden Thei don t understand that Bin Laden alon did not carri out the major act of terror that ar ascrib to him most recent the bomb of the USS Cole And until Iraq is punish for that terror it will continu In her ey the risk pose by Iraq grow dai by dai and year by year and now it is a risk that must be count by a second US Presid name Georg Bush For Datelin I am Dave Arlington
