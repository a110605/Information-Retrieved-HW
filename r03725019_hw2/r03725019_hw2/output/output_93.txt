The black plume of smoke rise from Yugoslavia s feder Parliament build as a flag wave throng storm the build will forev defin the Serbian revolut that toppl Slobodan Milosev In it wai the imag ha the forc of the photograph of a soldier plant the Soviet flag atop the Reichstag in Berlin in Both imag ar overwhelm in their gloriou final But Yevgeni Khaldei s Reichstag photograph wa a perfect represent of victori in a bloodi war wherea the icon imag of the end of Milosev s year rule seem to offer a partial truth Without the critic inject of forc at a pivot moment the hard men from central Serbia storm past the hesit polic and their tear ga the opposit s protest might have prove as ineffectu as thei so often had in the past But Milosev wa down less by violent upheav than by the broad massiv nonviol protest that ha character the fall of so mani authoritarian regim in recent year What goe around come around It wa alwai clear that the cycl of war that went out from Belgrad in the earli s would on dai end where it began Milosev and Balkan stabil were alwai incompat But what few predict wa that Serbia might join the Philippin Chile and the post communist state of central Europ in outlin a modern paradigm revolut through bloodless consensu In thi light Serbia s revolut wa perhap best captur by the fail attempt of the armi and it chief Nebojsa Pavkov to break a crippl strike at the Kolubara coal mine thi week Here a dai befor the storm of the Parliament it becam clear that the polic were unwil to us forc to break up a protest movement that had spread to worker So by the time that movement enter the Parliament it wa in effect pit against an enemi that had alreadi indic a willing to surrend As in so mani recent popular revolt the fall ruler s fate wa seal as he lost the instrument of power on by on Milosev wa strip first of the televis station he had us so skillfulli to stoke Serb nation and a brood sens of victim then of the court he had manipul which on Wednesdai nullifi the elect but on Fridai pronounc hi rival the winner and final of the polic and the armi Nonviol resist is not a magic wand it s a strategi said Jack DuVal the co author of A Forc More Power A Centuri of Nonviol Conflict St Martin Press a new book on peac protest The essenti thing as Gandhi saw is to detach a regim from it mean of support The Serbian opposit understood thi and the critic detach occur in the last two week It is not over yet of cours Serbia s soft revolut is still a muddl The style of Vojislav Kostunica the presid elect and a constitut lawyer who becam a revolutionari despit himself is slow move an advantag in coalit build but not necessarili in revolut handl in a state whose border remain unclear He is at the apex of a feder whose veri exist is in question He will have to confront the push for independ from Kosovo still nomin a Serbian provinc and a tens standoff with Montenegro the other republ of the Yugoslav feder Serbia ha yet to face the delic and charg question of how or whether it will confront the brutal of the Milosev year Kostunica is a democrat but he is also a Serbian nationalist though not of the virul strain Milosev foster and exploit He ha shown no inclin to bow to U S pressur to deliv Milosev to the intern war crime tribun in The Hagu and he ha said the question of war crime by Serb should be address alongsid the question of whether NATO too commit them when it bomb Serbia Event could spill in all kind of direct includ on that might leav Milosev and hi influenti wife Mira Markov no better off than Nicola Ceausescu and hi wife Elena who were execut by their fellow Romanian in If Kostunica ha continu urg restraint it is becaus he understand that aggress would mere have plai into the hand of a regim that alwai practic the polit of violenc Why plai on your enemi s term That calcul wa clear enough But what combin of the intern zeitgeist and the state of Serbia led Milosev to quit to spend more time with hi grandson he said rather than order hi forc to open fire and suppress Kostunica s revolt After all he had littl hesit in suppress Albanian striker in Kosovo in the late s or student in Belgrad in One factor is clearli that the post Cold War rise of the polit of ethic and human right after the discredit of totalitarian and communist system have limit a strongman s margin for maneuv especi as ani crackdown is instantan beam to a worldwid audienc Global polit and technolog ar inim to the us of brutal in wai that ar increasingli persuas and that did not exist in Pragu in The gener trend is such that ani armi command in a place like Serbia is go to ask Even if we can resist thi for on week scatter the protest for a few dai what then said Jonathan Eyal a British strateg analyst In commun wa a thing of the futur Todai you have to ask the point of execut an order to fire Especial for a man as isol as Milosev A ruin economi a lost war in Kosovo an indict from the tribun in The Hagu all led to hi progress alien from hi peopl and the countri around him Come home to Europ Toni Blair the British prime minist exhort the Serbian peopl as Milosev totter Europ here wa shorthand for human digniti democraci and the rule of law Such idea have prove increasingli compel Certainli from the fall of Ferdinand Marco in the Philippin in to the reject in a plebiscit of the Pinochet regim in Chile in to Romania in to the fail Soviet putsch in Moscow in to Serbia todai a pattern seem clear enough Once a catalyst ha spark nonviol protest on a broad scale the armi is not readi to fire or go on fire for long enough on it own peopl The except to thi pattern of cours wa at Tiananmen Squar where Chines author quash the student revolt No stronger imag of passiv resist could be found or imagin than the solitari student who stood befor a Chines tank Yet it prove ineffect The mistak in China wa the student decis to maxim demand befor try to broaden their movement Duval argu The success of nonviol protest ultim hing on have a broad base As Serb set fire to the feder Parliament build Gerhard Schroeder Germani s leader sent a messag to the Yugoslav armi and the Serbian polic forc My appeal and I sai thi as German chancellor on the basi of our experi dure the time of the Berlin Wall is don t fire on your own peopl That would be a tragedi In fact it wa the fall of the Wall that remov the last bastion in Moscow that might have given some cover for an act of violent repress by Milosev That is why he persist for so long in sai that the fall of the Soviet Union wa not irrevers As Milosev kept row against the tide of histori he increasingli develop a sort of soft dictatorship a dictablanda rather than a dictadura Thi combin element of a dictatorship a power secret polic effect control of the media fear monger propaganda a secret style of govern with act like hold the veri presidenti elect that ultim led to hi fall Hi error in the end wa to believ he could control the vote through the authoritarian method at hi dispos Once that fail he wa no longer enough of a dictat to hold power by other mean
