From hi distant view in downtown Norfolk Va Dave Rosenfield the gener manag of the Norfolk Tide said the Subwai Seri seem like a page out of some subterranean nightmar He ha been follow the drama read the duel headlin laden with talk of Civil War and battl He ha watch with the mix feel of someon with on foot in the basebal world of metaphor and simil and the other foot in the world of the U S Navi where real peopl sometim die defend the right of a countri to enjoi the nation pastim From Rosenfield s basebal standpoint the Seri is satisfi Bobbi Valentin manag at Norfolk in and Benni Agbayani plai at Norfolk from to Agbayani and hi wife were marri at home plate at the Tide Harbor Park befor the Internat Leagu s All Star Game Benni wa a gui who wa pass over and plai hard enough that he forc somebodi to look at him Rosenfield said Jai Payton plai at Norfolk in and Here s a gui who spent hi whole career injur until thi year Rosenfield said Thi is the first year that he s ever remain healthi Bobbi J Jone pitch the first game in the Tide new stadium in Thi year the Tide brief shine star wa Timo Perez who came out of nowher When thei sent him up to us in June Rosenfield said thei took Jason Tyner to the major and said We re go to send you Perez I said You re go to do what Who Nobodi knew him at all But on other front the impend Subwai Seri ha been a thorn in Rosenfield s side and a disappoint The ticket crush ha been dishearten Rosenfield wa allot ticket for each of the three game at Shea Stadium He ha no ticket for Yanke Stadium If I had ticket I couldn t take care of what I ve got he said We have our major sponsor our owner our investor our major advertis I ve had a list go sinc Juli It s been terribl It s taken some of the fun out of the anticip of the Seri for me But what realli took the joi out of the Seri wa the recent bomb attack against the Navi destroy Cole which took the live of crew member The Tide offic is onli minut south of the Norfolk Naval Station where the Cole is base The Tide organ ha develop a close relationship with the Navi Over the cours of each season we have a number of sailor who want to re enlist on the field Rosenfield said Two year ago the Tide were the host of the Internat Leagu All Star Game and toss a pregam parti on the USS Enterpris The team ha special price for activ member of the militari and doe a number of group night link to the naval base On Mai the Cole had such a night at Harbor Park Rosenfield said he wa devast by new of the attack I m terribl disturb he said It s kind of an eeri feel when you read about ani sort of a naval disast but particularli with a ship that s home port here the feel that you probabl met some of those gui It bring the world situat closer than you want it to be You d rather have thing detach but when someth like that happen it realli just bring it home Rosenfield who turn last spring can rememb when the Japanes attack Pearl Harbor I don t think ani of us in the Unite State felt the same thing about war that the peopl sai in Britain did Rosenfield said I think it wa brought home to us if we had rel that were kill or injur or captur but the fact is that the war realli never came to our street I think when you becom involv in a situat like we were in here with the Cole and the Navi you feel like it s on your block He wonder if Major Leagu Basebal would do someth to honor the sailor who lost their live and the sailor who surviv Perhap Major Leagu Basebal could invit the sailor to New York to attend a game I think that would give a marvel feel to the whole Seri Rosenfield said Later in the dai Commission Bud Selig said the idea had been toss around in a meet but had not gone much further The more he thought of it the more he said he realiz that a tribut dure basebal s greatest drama would be fit By the end of the dai Selig had discuss the matter with Rear Admiral Jai Folei command of the Naval Surfac Forc U S Atlantic Fleet Thei agre to have some of the sailor honor dure Game on Wednesdai at Shea Stadium Rosenfield said it wa the best new he had receiv in week We re go to do someth big Selig said We re go to bring as mani as we can we will do someth that honor each on of them But you know what s so amaz he ad Thei were flatter that we would even think about them That s what s so stun After what I ve put up with all dai with ticket request from peopl No thei will be more than appropri honor although as I said to the admir we re the on who ar honor You ve got to put life in it perspect Thi is a basebal game I us to tell myself that when the Brewer would blow a game and I d think the world wa come to an end And all of a sudden I d realiz you have to go through an evolut of realli understand what s import in life and what isn t Thi is the least we can do and it s hardli enough and it s noth compar to what thei ve done There were complaint that the New York New York World Seri wa too self absorb With survivor from the Cole come to the citi on Wednesdai the Subwai Seri is what New York is at it core a place and event the entir nation can embrac
