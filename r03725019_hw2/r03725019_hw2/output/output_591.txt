Histori at Harvard Univers in Washington Jeanni Madix Tungata is not optimist about Presid Gbagbo s abil to unifi a countri that ha over ethnic group and a larg immigr popul Nation reconcili will be a problem for him That s probabl the foremost issu on hi agenda at thi time Cutigua is compos of over differ ethnic group The first Presid and you know found father of the nation Ufwet Bueni understood the difficulti of hold togeth thi nation with such strong ethnic ident in the region So nation uniti ha alwai been a problem Professor Tungata point out that Ivori Coast s first Presid Felix Houphouet Boigni deliber suppress the format of sever polit parti sai thei would inevit divid along ethnic line and weaken nation uniti So he consolid power under on parti the Democrat parti of Ivori Coast known as the PDCI Upon Ufwet Bueni s death in two other major polit parti emerg The Ralli of the Republican or RDR an offshoot of the PDCI and the popular Ivorian front or FPI When Ufwet di Mr Henri Konan Bedi assum power And as Loui Ramirez report Mr Bedi s rule becam synonym with mismanag and corrupt To fend off polit rival Mr Bedi stir up Xenophobia aim at Muslim northern As Professor Tungata explain it wa Mr Bedi who introduc the exclusionari concept of In Cotibua Henri Konan Bedi initi thi system to determin whether peopl resid within the countri would be allow to have the nation ident card Thi nation ident card is necessari if in fact peopl ar to vote The effort for peopl from the South to then exclud peopl from the North from attain their ident card then becam an issu Why did thi becom an issu at thi time Henri Konan Bedi as he move closer and closer to the elect of knew that Alassan Ouattara would be return from the Internat Monetari Fund Alassan Ouattara had serv as an appoint Prime Minist under Ufwet and had been quit popular in that role And he had actual begun to build a consistu of support within the countri Gener Robert Guei who overthrew Mr Bedi in a bloodless coup last Decemb perpetu the notion that Mr Ouattara a Muslim from the North wa not a nativ of the Ivori Coast Howev Professor Tungata assert that earlier Suprem Court rule refut that claim It wa clear through the investig of the Suprem Court at that time that Alassan Ouattara wa in fact Ivorian Hi mother wa born in the Ogene region Hi father wa born in the region of Cong and had serv in the French Civil Servic It wa in the French tradit to send their civil servant to ani of their coloni within the region So at the time of independ Alassan Ouattara s father wa serv in the French Civil Servic in Upper Volta Upper Volta which is known todai as Burkina Faso is just across the border from Ivori Coast Subsequ Mr Ouattara wa award a scholarship to the Unite State and travel document from Burkina Faso Again Professor Tungata And so here begin the saga and the destruct of the charact of Alassan Ouattara Despit be bar from the recent presidenti elect which elev Laron Gbagbo to power Mr Ouattara doe plan to contest the upcom parliamentari elect on behalf of the RDR Professor Tungata sai these elect ar crucial to Ivori Coast s intern credibl The transpar of the legisl elect in Gbagbo s capac to ensur that these ar free and fair elect will determin the direct of the Western nation and their attitud toward the Gbagbo regim Howev if the recent ethnic and religi violenc continu to
