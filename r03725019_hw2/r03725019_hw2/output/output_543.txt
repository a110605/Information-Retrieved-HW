Kalashnikov s mother Erena see the releas of her son s note and the govern s appar concern for her famili as an effort to do right to make up for callou behavior in the past even buri peopl in secret The widow never knew what happen or how Ten year later thei might receiv some certif but in the case of the Kursk everyth ha been done with great open But other ar not so sure open is the right wai to describ the govern s reaction and sai it is too earli to herald in a new era of offici honesti Alexand Gold Militari Analyst for Etoge a weekli new magazin believ Dimitr Kalashnikov s note which contradict statement of both the Northern Fleet and the Kremlin wa onli releas becaus there wa no wai to stop it public There ar few theori unfortun we can onli specul It look like that it happen becaus of a few circumst First the weather wa so bad that thei cannot immedi take what is from Norwegian ship Regalla through the coast to save her at risk That s why thei had to make first examin of the boarder on board of Regalla Second there were two peopl on Regalla the man from gener militari prosecutor offic and medic expert both of them have not to report directli to fleet command If thei tri to hide thi note it can came to the surfac immedi onli becaus it had happen on a foreign ship and there can be theoret some wit But now there is more that just Dimitr Kalashnikov note Russia s Deputi Prime Minist Eliac Ivanov in charg of the commiss investig the caus of the sink of the Kursk sai a second note wa recov from a dead crewman which read We ar get weaker from the effect of carbon monoxid follow the fire Pressur is rise If we get out we won t stand the compress The sailor who wrote the note said he doubt the men would surviv for more than hour inform which support the govern in the sens that it prove rescu team would not have had enough time to save ani of the sailor slowli suffoc in the Kursk s th compart In whatev wai inform will be reveal the fact that at least some of the men surviv for at least a few hour brought the tragedi back into peopl heart onc again While it wa not the first time Russian sailor di at sea it wa the first time that such a disast wa so public and the govern s respons so critic monitor both worldwid and at home VOA s Eve Connett report from St Petersburg Naval Analyst Norman Palmer is the author of more than book mani of them on submarin warfar Mr Palmer sai the Kursk wa actual equip with on of the most modern escap system in the world includ a capsul that wa capabl of carri the entir crew to the surfac But it wa damag or perhap destroi in the explos But beyond that the surviv crewmen in the rear end of the submarin should have been abl to us their own individu escap devic to reach the surfac Separ from that there ar sever method of peopl on the outsid world come to the submarin and rescu ani survivor out of the submarin But that requir a escap hatch or escap compart in the submarin that is still us and if the explos mai have sever damag that capabl also But also you have to have the rescu equip from a surfac ship in the area rapidli within a dai two or at most three dai We don t know the full detail of the Russian respons at least we don t in the West at thi time When you deal with the Russian and their Soviet progenitor of cours you ar also deal with the massiv secur issu where thei would not want outsid help becaus of featur both outsid and insid of the submarin thei would not want foreign intellig to have access to Becaus the damag to the Kursk wa far more seriou than ani on realiz at the time Mr Palmer sai neither the crew s own escap capabl nor the Russian navi s rescu capabl wa abl to deal with the problem and ultim the fail rescu turn into a public relat disast The recoveri of letter written by the trap Russian submarin ha made the situat even more poignant But rememb in the old dai the Soviet regim would never have releas those letter Right The letter would never been seen by the press or the famili and I think you have a situat where post Cold War Russian public relat ha not caught up with the real world Naval Analyst Norman Palmer author of mani book on submarin warfar The crew trap beneath the sea wa the subject of todai s Datelin I m Judith Latham
