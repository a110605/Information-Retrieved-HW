subject tonight and the question ar mine The format tonight is that of a convers The onli prevail rule is that no singl respons can ever ever exce two minut The prevail rule for the audienc here in the hall is as alwai absolut quiet pleas Good even Governor Bush Vice Presid Gore In about minut last week in Boston the total time each of you took wa virtual the same Let see if we can do the same tonight or come close Governor Bush the first question goe to you One of you is about to be elect the leader of the singl most power nation in the world econom financi militarili diplomat you name it Have you form ani guid principl for exercis thi enorm power I have I have First question is what s in the best interest of the Unite State What s in the best interest of our peopl When it come to foreign polici that will be my guid question Is it in our nation s interest Peac in the Middl East is in our nation s interest Have a hemispher that is free for trade and peac is in our nation s interest Strong relat in Europ is in our nation s interest I have thought a lot about what it mean to be the Presid I also understand that an administr is not on person but an administr is dedic citizen who ar call by the Presid to serv the countri to serv a caus greater than self And so I have thought about an administr of peopl who repres all America The peopl understand by compassion and conserv philosophi I haven t start name ani name except for on person That s Mr Richard Chenei who I thought did a great job the other night He is a vice Presidenti nomine who repres who I think peopl got to see why I pick him He is a man of solid judgment and he is go to be a person to stand by my side One of the thing that I ve done in Texa is I have been abl to put togeth a good team of peopl I have been abl to set clear goal The goal ar to be an educ system that leav no child behind medicar for senior a social secur system that s safe and secur foreign polici that s in our nation s interest and a strong militari And then bring peopl togeth to achiev those goal That s what our chief execut offic doe So I have thought long and hard about the honor of be the Presid of the Unite State Vice Presid Gore Ye Jim I ve thought a lot about that particular question and I see our greatest nation strength come from what we stand for in the world I see it as a question of valu It is a great tribut to our founder that year later thi nation is now look to by the peopl on everi contin and the peopl from everi part of thi earth as a kind of model for what their futur could be And I don t think that s just the kind of exagger that we take pride in as American that s realli true Even the on that some time shake their fist at us As soon as thei have a chang that allow the peopl to speak freeli thei re want to develop some kind of a blueprint that will help them be like us more freedom free market polit freedom So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wield in wai that form a more perfect union The power of exampl is America s greatest power in the world And that mean for exampl stand up for human right It mean address the problem of injustic and inequ along line of the race and ethnic here at home becaus in all these other place around the world where thei re have these terribl problem when thei feel hope it is often becaus thei see in us a reflect of their potenti So we ve got to enforc our Civil Right Law We ve got to deal with thing like racial profil And we have to keep our militari strong We have the strongest militari and I ll do what ever is necessari if I m Presid to make sure that it stai that wai But our real power come I think from our valu Should the peopl of the world look at the Unite State Governor and sai should thei fear us should thei welcom our involv Do thei see us as a friend everybodi in the world How do you how would you project us around the world as Presid Well I think thei all look at us as a countri that understand freedom It doesn t matter who you ar or how you re rais or where you re from that you can succe I don t think thei will look at us with envi It realli depend upon how our nation conduct itself in foreign polici If we ar an arrog nation thei will resent us If we ar a humbl nation but strong thei will welcom us And our nation stand alon right now in the world in term of power And that s why we ve got be humbl and yet project strength in a wai that promot freedom So I don t think thei look at us in anywai other than what we ar We re a freedom love nation and if we re an arrog nation thei ll view us that wai But if we ar a humbl nation thei ll respect us A humbl nation I agre with that I agre with that I think that on of the problem that we have face in the world is that we ar so much more power than ani singl nation ha been in relationship to the rest of the world that at ani time in histori that I know about anywai that there is some resent of U S power So I think that the idea of humil is an import on But I think that we also have to have a sens of mission in the world We have to protect our capac to push forward what America is all about That mean not onli militari strength and our valu It also mean keep our economi strong You know in the last two decad ago it wa routin for leader of foreign countri to come over here and sai you gui have got to do someth about these horrend deficit becaus it s caus tremend problem for the rest of the world And we were lectur to all the time The fact that we have the strongest economi in histori todai is not good enough We need to do more but the fact that it is so strong enabl us to project the power for good that America can repres Doe our wealth our good economi our power bring with it special oblig to the rest of the world Ye it doe Take for exampl third world debt I think we ought be forgiv third world debt under certain condit I think for exampl if we ar convinc that a third world countri that ha got a lot of debt would reform itself that the monei wouldn t go into the hand of a few but would go to help peopl then I think it make sens for us to us our wealth in that wai We have alreadi trade debt for valuabl rain forest land make emin sens Ye we do have an oblig But we can t be all thing to all peopl We can help build We can lend monei but we ve got to do it wise We shouldn t be lend monei to corrupt offici so we got to be guard in our generos Let s go through some of the specif now New question vice Presid Gore the governor mention Middl East Here we ar talk at thi stage in the game about diplomat power that we have Uh huh What do you think the Unite State should do right now to resolv that conflict over there The first prioriti ha to be on end the violenc dampen down the tension that have risen there We need to call upon Syria to releas the three Israeli soldier who have been captur and we need to insist that Arafat send out instruct to halt some of the provoc act of violenc that have been go on I think that we also have to keep a weather ey toward the Sadam Hussain becaus he is take advantag of the situat to onc again make threat and he need to understand that he is not onli deal with Israel he is deal with us if he is make the kind of threat that he is talk about there The us of diplomaci in thi situat ha alreadi well it goe hour by hour and dai by dai now it s a veri tens situat there but in the last hour there ha been some subsid of the violenc there It s too much to hope that thi is go to continu but I do hope that it will continu Our countri ha been veri activ with the regular convers with the leader there and we just have to take it dai to dai right now but on thing I would sai where diplomaci is concern Israel should feel absolut secur about on thing Our bond with Israel ar larger than agreement or disagr on some detail of diplomat initi Thei ar histor thei ar strong and thei ar endur and our abil to serv as an honest broker is someth that we need to shapeup Governor Well I think dure the campaign particularli now dure thi difficult period we ve got to be speak with on voic and I appreci the wai the administr ha work hard to calm the tension like the Vice Presid had call on Chairman Arafat to have hi peopl pull back to make the peac I think credibl is go to be veri import in the futur in the Middl East I want everybodi to know should I be the Presid Israel is go to be our friend and will stand by Israel Secondli that I think it s import to reach out to moder Arab nation like Jordan and Egypt Saudi Arabia and Kuwait It s import to be friend with peopl when you know you need each other so that when you do there is a strong bond of friendship and that s go to be particularli import in deal not onli with situat such as now occur in Israel but with Sadam Hussian The coalit against Sadam ha fallen apart or it s unravel to put it that wai The sanction ar be violat There is we don t know whether he is develop weapon of mass destruct He better not be or there is go to be a consequ should I be the Presid but it s import to have credibl and credibl is form by be strong with your friend and resolut in your determin It s on of the reason why I think it s import for thi nation to develop an antiballist missil system and that we can share with our alli in the Middl East if need be to keep the peac to be abl to sai to the Sadam Hussain of the world or the Iranian don t dare threaten our friend It s also import to keep strong ti in the Middl East credibl ti becaus of the energi crisi we re now in After all all the energi is produc from the Middl East and so I appreci what the administr is do and I hope you get a sens of should I be fortun to be the Presid how my administr will react to Middl East So you don t believ Vice Presid Gore that we should take side in thi and resolv thi right now Lot of peopl ar push hei we the Unite State should declar itself and not be so neutral in thi particular situat Well we stand with Israel but we have maintain the abil to serv as an honest broker and on of the reason that s import is that Israel cannot have direct dialogu with some of the peopl on the other side of conflict especi dure time of tension unless that dialogu come through us And if we throw awai that abil to serv as an honest broker then we would have thrown awai a strateg asset that s import not onli to us but also to Israel You agre with that You ar listen to the US Presidenti candid debat live from Winston Salem North Carolina on VOA New Now Discuss take place there ha got to be a timet that all parti can agre to you know like the Palestinian and Israeli Secondli ani last peac is go to have to be a peac that s good for both side and therefor the term honest broker make sens whether thi current administr work hard to keep the parti at the tabl I would try to do the same thing but it won t be on my timet It will be on a timet that peopl ar comfort with in the Middl East Peopl watch here tonight ar veri interest in Middl East polici and thei ar so interest that thei want to make a thei want to base their vote on differ between the two of you as Presid how you would handl Middl East polici Is there ani differ I haven t heard a big differ right in the last few exchang Well I know it s hard to tell I think that you know I would hope to be abl to convinc peopl I could handl the Iraqi situat better With Sadam Hussain you mean Ye and I can You can get him out of there I d like to of cours and I presum thi administr would as well but we don t know there is no inspector now in Iraq the coalit that wa in place isn t as strong as it us to be He is the danger We don t want him fish in troubl water in the Middl East becaus it s go to be hard to it s go to be import to rebuild that coalit to keep the pressur on him You feel that as the failur of the Clinton administr i do Well when I got to be a part of the current administr it wa right after I wa on of the few member of my polit parti to support former Presid Bush in the Persian Gulf war resolut And at the end of that war for whatev reason it wa not finish in a wai that remov Sadam Hussain from power I know there ar all kind of circumst and explan but the fact is that that s the situat that wa left when I got there and we have maintain the sanction Now I want to go further I want to give robust support to the group that ar try to overthrow Sadam Hussain and I know their alleg that thei ar too weak to do it but that s what thei said about the forc that were oppos Milosev in Serbia And you know the polici of enforc sanction against Serbia ha just result in a spectacular victori for democraci just in the past week and it seem to me that have taken so long to see the sanction work there build upon the polici of contain that wa success over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block seem a littl earli to declar that we should give up on the sanction I know the governor is not necessarili sai that but you know all of these flight that have come in all of them have been in accord with the sanction regim I am told except for three where thei notifi and thei ar try to break out of the box there is no question about it I don t think thei should be allow to Did he correct you did he state your posit correctli you ar not call for elimin the sanction ar you No of cours not absolut not I want to be tougher Let s go on to Milosev and Yugoslavia and it fall into the area of our militari power Governor New question should the fall of Milosev be seen as a triumph for U S militari intervent I think it s a triumph I thought the Presid made the right decis in join NATO and bomb Serbia I support him when thei did so I call upon the Congress not to hamstr the administr and in term of forc troop withdraw on a timet that wasn t in necessarili our best interest or fit our nation s strategi Henc I think it s good public polici I think it work and I am pleas I took thi made the decis I made and pleas that the Presid made the decis he made becaus freedom took hold in that part of the world and where there is a lot of work left to be done howev But you think it would not have happen do you think that Milosev would not have fallen if the Unite State and NATO had not interven militarili Is thi a legitim us of our militari power Ye I think it is absolut I don t think he would have fallen had we not us forc and I know there ar some in my parti that disagre with that sentiment but I support the Presid I thought he made the right decis to do so I didn t think he necessarili made the right decis to take land troop off the tabl right befor we commit ourselv offens but nevertheless it work The administr deserv credit for have made it work It s import for NATO to have it work It s import for NATO to be strong and confid to help keep the peac in Europ and on of the reason I felt so strongli that the Unite State need to particip wa becaus of our relat with NATO and NATO is go to be an import part of keep the peac in the futur And there is more work to do or mai as we have seen how whether or not it is go to be a polit settlement to Kosovo and I certainli hope there is on I have also on record of sai at some point time I hope our European friend becom the peacekeep in Bosnia and in the Balkan I hope that thei put the troop on the ground so that we can withdraw our troop and focu our militari on fight and win war Well I ve been kind of a hard liner on thi issu for more than eight year when I wa in the Senat befor I becam Vice Presid I wa push for stronger action against Milosev he caus the death of so mani peopl he wa the last communist parti boss there and then he becam a dictat that by some other label he wa still essenti a communist dictat and unfortun now he is try to reassert himself in Serbian polit alreadi Just todai the member of hi polit parti said that thei were go to ignor the order of the new Presid of Serbia and that thei question hi legitimaci and he is still go to try to be activ involv He is an indit war crimin He should be held account Now I did want to pick up on on of the statement earlier and mayb I have heard the previou statement wrong governor I some of the discuss we ve had about when it s appropri for the US to us forc around the world at time the standard that you ve laid down have given me the impress that if it s someth like a genocid take place or what thei call ethnic cleans in Bosnia that that wouldn t be the kind of situat that would caus you to think that the US ought to get involv with troop Now there have to be other factor involv for me to want to be involv but by itself that to me it can bring into plai a fundament American strateg interest becaus I think it s base on our valu now have I got that wrong All right sir Okai yeah Try to figur out of what the question wa All right yeah If I think it s in our nation strateg interest I will commit truce I thought it wa in our strateg interest to keep Milosev in check becaus of our relat in NATO and that s why I took the posit I took and I think it s import for NATO to be strong and confid I felt like an uncheck Milosev would harm NATO and it so depend on the situat Mr Vice Presid Well let s keep for a moment New question relat to thi I figur thi out in the last year there have been eight major action involv introduct of US ground air or naval forc I mean in Lebanon Grenada Panama the Persian Gulf Somalia Bosnia Haiti Kosovo If you had been Presid ani of those intervent would ani of those intervent not have happen Can you run through the list again Sure Lebanon I thought that wa a mistak Grenada I support that Panama I support them Persian Gulf Ye I vote for it support it Somalia Of cours and that again no I think that that wa ill consid I did support it at the time it wa in the previou administr in the Bush Quaill administr and I think in retrospect the lesson there ar on that we should take veri veri serious Bosnia Oh ye Haiti ye And in Kosovo we talk about that ye Want me to do with you no You want to go be Lebanon I ll make it cut short Absolut sure Somalia start off as a humanitarian mission then chang into a nation build mission and that s where the mission went wrong The mission wa chang and as a result our nation paid a price and so I don t think our troop ought to be us for what s call nation build and our troop ar be us to fight and win war I think our troop ar be us to help overthrow a dictat when it s in our best interest But in thi case it wa a nation build exercis and same with Haiti I wouldn t have support either What about Lebanon ye Grenada ye Panama ye Obviousli the first Someon might get a conflict of interest on if you know what I mean i do i do You ar the Persian Gulf obvious and Yeah And Bosnia and you ve alreadi talk about about Kosovo but the revers side of the question Governor that vice Presid Gore mention When peopl di and in Rwanda there wa no U S intervent and no intervent from the outsid world Wa that a mistak not to interven I think the administr did the right thing in that case I do It wa a horribl situat no on like to see it on our TV screen but it s a case where we need to make sure we ve got a you know a kind of an earli warn system in place in place where there could be ethnic cleans and genocid the wai we saw there in Rwanda and that s a case where we need to you know us our influenc to have countri in Africa come togeth and help deal with thi situat Administr last night but the administr made the right decis on train Nigerian troop for situat just such as thi in Rwanda and so I thought thei made the right decis not to send US troop into Rwanda Do you have ani second thought on that base on what you said a moment ago about genocid I would like to come back to the question of nation build but let me address thi question directli first fine We did actual send troop into Rwanda to help with humanitarian relief measur my wife Tipper who is here actual went on a militari plane with Gener Shalikashvili on on of those flight but I think in retrospect we were too late get in there we could ve save more live if we had act earlier but I do not think that it wa an exampl of a conflict where we should ve put our troop in to try to separ the parti for thi reason Jim One of the criteria that I think is import in decid when and if we should ever get involv around the world is whether or not our nation secur interest is involv if we can realli make the differ with militari forc if we tri everyth els if we have alli In the Balkan we had alli NATO readi will and abl to go and carri a big part of the burden In Africa we did not now our countri ha tri to creat an Africa crisi respons team there and we met some resist We have had somewhat with Nigeria but in Sierra Leon and that now Nigeria ha becom a democraci we hope it stai that wai then mayb we can build on that But becaus we had no alli and becaus it wa veri unclear that we could actual accomplish what we would want to accomplish about put militari forc there up I think it wa the right thing not to jump in as heart break as it wa but I think we should ve come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission So what would you sai Governor to somebodi who would sai Hei wait a minut why not Africa tell me why the Middl East why the Balkan but not Africa when peopl s live ar at risk Oh I understand and Africa is import and we got to do lot of work in Africa to promot democraci and trade and as Vice Presid mention Nigeria is a fledgl democraci we ve to work with Nigeria It s an import contin but there is got to be prioriti and Middl East is a prioriti for a lot of reason as is Europ and the Far East in our own hemispher and those ar my four top prioriti should I be the Presid not to sai we won t be engag nor should we work hard to get other nation to come togeth to prevent atroc I thought the best exampl of a wai to handl a situat as each team wa when we provid logist support to the Australian support that onli we can provid I thought that wa a good model but we can t be all thing to all peopl in the world Jim and I think that s where mayb the Vice Presid and I begin to have differ I am worri about over commit our militari around the world I want to be judici in it us You ve mention Haiti I wouldn t have sent troop to Haiti I did not think it wa a mission worthwhil it wa a nation build mission and it wa not veri success it cost us billion coupl of billion of dollar and I am not so sure democraci is ani better off in Haiti than it wa befor Vice Presid would you agre with the Governor s view on nation build the us of militari Thi is VOA New Now from Washington with live coverag of the U S Presidenti candid debat from Winston Salem North Carolina And evalu ani potenti us of American troop oversea I think we have to be veri retic about that But look Jim the world is chang and so rapidli the wai I see it the world is get much closer togeth Like it or not we ar now the Unite State is now the natur leader of the world All these other countri ar look to us Now just becaus we cannot be involv everywher and shouldn t be doesn t mean that we should shy awai both of us ar kind of I guess state the other s posit in a maximalist stream wai but I think there is a differ here Thi idea of nation build is a kind of a pejor phrase but think about the great conflict of the past centuri World War II Dure the year between World War I and World War II a great lesson wa learnt by our militari leader and the peopl of the Unite State The lesson wa that in the aftermath of World War I we kind of turn our back and left them to their own devic and thei brew up a lot of troubl that quickli becam World War II and act upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victori in World War II we laid down the Marshal plan Presid Truman did All right we got intermitt involv in build NATO and other structur there We still have lot of troop in Europ and what did we do in the late s and s and s We were nation build and it wa econom but it wa also militari and the confid that those countri recov from the wound of war had by have troop that we had civil administr come in to set up their wai of build their town back Ye but you said in the Boston debat Governor on thi issu of nation build that the Unite State militari is overextend now Where is it overextend Where ar the US militari that you would bring home if you becom Presid Well first let me just sai on comment about what the Vice Presid said I think on of the lesson in between World War I and World War II is we let our militari atrophi and we can t do that We got to rebuild our militari But on of the problem we have in the militari is we re in a lot of place around the world and I mention on that s the Balkan I d veri much like to get our troop out of there I recogn we can t do it now nor do I advoc an immedi withdraw I think that would be an abrog of our agreement with NATO No on is suggest that but I think it ought to be on of our prioriti to work with our European friend to convinc them to put troop on the ground and there is an exampl Haiti is anoth exampl and now there ar some place where I think you know I support the administr in Colombia I think it s import for us to be train Colombian in that part of the world it s for hemispher s interest to have a peac Colombia but Use of the militari There ar some peopl who ar now suggest that if you don t want to us the militari to maintain the peac to do the simpl thing is it time to consid a civil forc of some kind that come in after the militari that build nation or all of that Is that on your radar screen I don t think so I think what we need to do is convinc peopl who live in the land thei live in to build the nation Mai be I m miss someth here I mean you go to have a nation build core from America Absolut not our militari is meant to fight and win war That s what it s meant to do and when it get overextend moral drop and I m not Jim I strongli believ we need to have a militari presenc in the Greek Peninsula not onli to keep the peac in the peninsula but to keep region stabil and I strongli believ we need to keep our presenc in NATO But I m go to be judici as to how to us the militari and these be in our vital interest the mission need to be clear and the extra strategi obviou Well I don t disagre with that and I certainli don t disagre that we ar to get our troop home from place like the Balkan as soon as we can as soon as the mission is complet that s what we did in Haiti There ar no more than a hand of American militari personnel in Haiti now and Haitian have their problem but we gave them a chanc to restor democraci and that s realli about all we can do But if you have a situat like that right in our backyard with chao about to break out and flotilla form to come across the water and all kind of violenc there right in on of our neighbor countri there then I think that we did the right thing there and as for thi idea of nation build the phrase sound grandios and you know we can t be we can t allow ourselv to get overextend I certainli agre with that and that s why I ve support build up our capac I have devot in the budget I ve propos as I said last week more than twice as much as the Governor ha propos I think that it s in better shape now than he gener doe We ve had some disagr about that and he said that two divis would have to report not readi for duti and as that we have to continu build up readi and militari strength and we have to also be veri cautiou in the wai we us our militari In the non militari area of influenc event around the world the financi and econom area World Bank Presid Wolfenson said recent Governor that US contribut to oversea develop and assist is lower now almost than it ha ever been Is that a problem for you do you think what is your idea about what the Unite State oblig ar I m talk about financi assist and that sort of thing to other countri the poor countri Well I mention third world that s a place where we can us our generos to influenc in a posit wai influenc nation I believ we ought to have foreign aid but I don t think we all just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid I think foreign aid need to be us to encourag market and reform I think a lot of time we just spend aid and sai we just would feel better about it end up be spent the wrong wai and there ar some pretti egregi exampl recent on be Russia where we had IMF loan that end up in the pocket of a lot of power peopl and didn t the help the nation I think the IMF ha got a role in the world but I don t want to see the IMF out there as a wai to sai to world banker if you make a bad loan we ll bail you out And these have been avail for emerg situat I thought the Presid did the right thing with Mexico and wa veri strongli support with the administr in Mexico But I don t think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for peopl who aren t be abl to evalu risk themselv So I look at everi place where we ar invest monei I just want to make sure the return is good You think we re meet our oblig properli No I would make some chang I think there need to be reform in the IMF I ve gener support it but I have seen them make some call that I thought were highli question and I think that there is the gener agreement in mani part of the world now that there ar to be chang in the IMF The World Bank I think is gener do a better job But I think on of the big issu here that doesn t get nearli enough attent is the issu of corrupt The Governor mention it earlier I ve work on thi issu it s an enorm problem and corrupt in offici agenc like militari and polic depart around the world custom offici That s on of the worst form of it and we have got to again lead by exampl and help these other countri that ar try to straighten out their situat find the tool in order to do it I just think Jim that thi is an absolut uniqu period in world histori The world is come togeth as I said thei ar look to us and we have a fundament choic to make Are we go to step up to the plai as the nation the wai we did after World War II The wai that gener of hero said okai the Unite State is go to be the leader and the world benefit tremend from the courag that thei show in those post war year I think that in the aftermath of the cold war it s time for us to do someth veri similar to step up to the plai to provid the leadership leadership on the environ leadership to make sure the world economi keep move in the right direct Again that mean not run big deficit here and not squander our surplu that mean have intellig decis that keep our prosper go and keep in shape that econom shrink so that we can provid that leadership role Let me comment on that Sure Yeah I m not so sure the role of the Unite State is to go around the world and sai thi is the wai it s got to be We can help and mayb it s just our differ in govern The wai we do govern I mean I want empow peopl I don t you know I want to help peopl help themselv not have govern tell peopl what to do I just don t think it s the role of the Unite State to walk into a countri sai we do it wai so should you And I think we can help and I know we ve got to encourag democraci in the market place You take Russia for exampl We went into Russia we said here sir I have made monei that end up in Victor Chernomyrdin s pocket and other and yet we plai like there is reform The onli peopl who ar go to reform Russia ar Russian Thei ar go to have to make the decis themselv Mr Putin is go to have to make the decis as to whether or not he want to adher to real law and normal account practic so that if countri and or entiti invest capit there is a reason rate of return a wai to get the monei out of the economi but Russia ha to make the decis We can work with them on secur matter for exampl but it s their call to make So I am not exactli sure where the Vice Presid is come from but I think on wai for us to end up be view as the ugli American is for us to go around the world sai we do it thi wai so should you Now we trust freedom we know freedom is a power forc much bigger than the Unite State of America as we saw recent in the Balkan but mai be I am misunderstand where your ar come from Mr Vice Presid but I think the Unite State must be humbl and must be proud and confid of our valu but humbl in how we treat nation that ar figur out how to chart their own cours Let s move on All right no let move on Far be it for me to suggest otherwis First a coupl of follow up from the vice Presidenti debat last week Vice Presid Gore would you support or sign as Presid of feder law ban racial profil by polic and other author at all level of govern Ye I would The onli thing an execut order can accomplish is to ban it in feder law enforc agenc but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of do the same thing I think that racial profil is a seriou problem I rememb when the stori first came out about the stop in New Jersei about the highwai patrol there and I know it s been go on a long time in some wai thi is just a new label for someth that s been go on for year but I have to confess that it wa the first time that I ve realli focuss on it in a new wai and I wa surpris at the extent and I think we now got so mani exampl around the countri that we realli have to find wai to end thi Imagin what it is like for someon to be singl out unfairli unjustli and feel the unfair forc of law simpli becaus of race or ethnic Now that run counter to what the Unite State of America is all about at our core and it s not an easi problem to solv but if I am entrust with the presid it will be the first civil right act of the st centuri Yeah I can imagin what it would be like to be singl out becaus of race and stop and harass it s just veri wrong and that s not what America is all about and so we have to do everyth we can to end racial profil One of my concern though is I don t want to feder the local polic forc I want to obvious in egregi case we need to enforc civil right law but we need to make sure that intern affair divis at the local level do their job and be given a chanc to do their job I believ in local control of govern and obvious if thei don t there need to be a consequ at the feder level but it s veri import that we not overstep our bounc and I think most peopl most polic offic ar good dedic honor citizen who ar do their job put their live at risk who aren t bigot or aren t prejud I don t think thei ar to be held guilti but I do think we need to find out where racial profil occur and do someth about it and sai to the local folk get it done and if you can t there will be feder consequ And that could be a feder law Yeah And you agre I would agre and I also agre that most polic offic of cours ar do a good job and hate thi practic also I talk to an African American polic offic in Springfield Massachusett not long ago who rais thi question and said on of the biggest solut wa in the train and not onli the train in polic procedur but human relat And I think that racial profil is part of a larger issu how we deal with race in America and as for singl peopl out becaus of race you know Jame Bird wa singl out becaus of hi race in Texa and other American have been singl out becaus of Thi is VOA New Now bring you live coverag of the U S Presidenti candid debat from Winston Salem North Carolina Our valu by pass a hate crime law I think these crime ar differ I think thei ar differ becaus thei ar base on prejudic and hatr which give rise to crime that have not just a singl victim but thei ar intend to stigmat and dehuman a whole group of peopl Do you have a differ view of that No I don t realli on hate crime law we got on in Texa and guess what the three men who murder Jame Bird guess what s go to happen to them Thei ar go to be put to death A juri found them guilti and it s go to be hard to punish them ani wors after thei get put to death and it is the right caus so it s the right decis And secondli there is other form of racial profil that goe on in America Arab American ar racial profil on what s call secret evid Peopl ar stop and we ve got to do someth about that My friend Senat Spencer Abraham of Michigan is push a law to make sure that Arab American ar treat with respect So racial profil isn t just an issu with local polic forc it s an issu throughout our societi and as we becom a divers societi we re go to have to deal with it more and more I believ sure as I m sit here that most American realli care thei ar toler peopl a good toler peopl It is the veri few that creat most of the crise and we just have to find them and deal with them What if you becom Presid Governor ar there other area racial problem area which you would deal with as Presid involv discrimin Sure As you just said Arab American but also Hispan Asian as well as black in thi countri Let me tell where the biggest discrimin come in public educ when we just move children through the school My friend Phylli Horner here she had won the greatest lion of all lion She said read is the new civil right and she is right and to make sure our societi is as hope as it possibl can be everi singl child in America must be educ I mean everi child It start with make sure everi child learn to read K through two diagnost test so we know whether or not there is a defici Curriculum that work and phonet need to be an integr part of our read curriculum Test read laboratori teacher re train and there need to be a wholesal effort against racial profil which is their liter children We can do better in our public school We can close our achiev gap and it start with make sure we have strong account Jim One of the cornerston of reform and good reform is to measur becaus when you measur you can ask the question do thei know Is anybodi be profil Is anybodi be discrimin against it It becom a tool a correct tool and I believ the feder govern must sai that if you receiv ani monei ani monei from the feder govern for disadvantag children for exampl you must show us whether or not the children ar learn and if thei ar fine and if thei ar not there ha to be a consequ And so to make sure we end up we ar get rid of the basic structur prejudic is educ There is noth more prejud than not educ a child Vice Presid Gore what would be on your racial discrimin elimin list as Presid Well I think we need tough enforc of the civil right law I think we still need affirm action I would pass sai hate crime law I said and I guess I had misunderstood the Governor s previou posit the Bird famili mai have a misunderstand of it in Texa also but I would like to shift if I could to quit the biggest Hold on on second What is the misunderstand Let s clear thi out Well I had thought that there wa a controversi at the end of the legisl session where the hate crime law in Texa wa fail and that the Bird famili among other ask you to support it the Governor and it di in committe for lack of support am I wrong about that Well you don t realiz we have a hate crime statut over here I m talk about the on that wa propos to deal What the Vice Presid must now understand is we ve got hate crime bill in Texa and secondli the peopl that murder Mr Bird got the ultim punish the death penalti Thei were prosecut under murder law were thei not We ll check thi out Well in thi case when you murder somebodi it s hate Jim The crime is hate and thei got the ultim punish I m not exactli sure how you d enhanc the penalti ani more than the death penalti but we haven t had the statut on the book that hate crime statut in Texa Mai I respond Sure I don t want to jump you know I mai have been misl by all the new report about thi matter becaus the law that wa propos in Texa that ha the support of the Bird famili and a whole lot of peopl in Texa did in fact die in committe There mai be some other statut that wa alreadi on the book but certainli the advoc of the hate crime law felt that a tough new law wa need and it s import Jim not onli not just becaus of Texa but becaus thi mirror the nation controversi There is pend now in the Congress a nation hate crime law becaus of Jame Bird becaus of Matthew Shephard who wa crucifi on a split rail fenc by bigot becaus of other and that law ha di in committe also becaus of the same kind of opposit And you would support that Absolut Would you support a nation hate crime law I would support the Owen Hat version of it not the Senat Kennedi version but let me sai to you Mr Vice Presid we ar happi with our law and our book that bill did There wa anoth bill that did die in committe But I want to repeat if you have a state that fulli support the law like we do in Texa we ar go to after all crime And we ar go to make sure peopl get punish for the crime and in thi case we can t enhanc the penalti anymor than put those three thug to death And that s what s go to happen in the state of Texa New subject new question anoth vice Presidenti debat follow up Governor both Senat Lieberman and Secretari Chenei said thei were sympathet rethink their view on same sex relationship What s your posit on that I m not for gai marriag I think marriag is a sacr institut between a man and a woman and I appreci the wai the administr sign the Defens of Marriag Act I presum the Vice Presid support when the Presid sign that bill support it now But I think the marriag is sacr institut and will be respect For peopl who mai disagre with me I have had a record of do so in the state of Texa I have been a person that would been call the unit not divid becaus I accept other peopl s point of view but I feel strongli that marriag should be a between a man and woman Vice Presid Gore I agre with that and I did support that law But I think that we should find a wai to allow some kind of civic union and I basic agre with Dick Chenei and Joe Lieberman and I think that three of us have on view and the Governor ha anoth Is that right I m not sure what kind of view describ you to me I will just tell you I m a person who respect other peopl I respect their I respect on he sai he agre with me and then he sai he doesn t I m not sure where he is come from But I will be a toler person I have been a toler person all my life I just happen to believ strongli that marriag is between a man and woman Do you believ in gener term that gai and lesbian should have the same right as other American Ye I don t think thei have ani special right but I think thei will all have the same right Well there is a law pend call the employ non discrimin act I strongli support it What it sai is that gai and lesbian can t be fire from their job becaus thei ar gai or lesbian and it would be a feder law prevent them I wonder if that it s been block by the oppon in the major in the Congress I wonder if the Governor would lend a support to that law question come round here Well it s logic Well I have no idea I mean you can throw all kind I don t know the particular of thi law I will tell you I m the kind of person I don t hire or fire somebodi base upon their sex orient As a matter of fact I would like to take the issu a littl further I don t realli think it s ani of my concern about how you conduct your sex life and I think it s a privat matter and I think that s the wai it ought to be But I am go to be respect for peopl I will toler peopl and I support equal right but not special right for peopl And special right how doe that effect gai and lesbian Well if thei re given special protector statu and that doesn t mean we shouldn t fulli enforc law and fulli protect peopl and fulli honor peopl which I would do as the Presid of the Unite State New subject new question Vice Presid Gore How do you see the connect between control gun sale in thi countri and the incid of death by accident or intent us of gun Jim I hope that we can come back to the subject of educ becaus the Governor made an extens statement on it and I have a veri differ view than the on he express but that have be been said I believ that well first of all let me sai that the Governor and I agre on someth where thi subject is concern I will not do anyth to affect the right of hunter or sportsmen I think that homeown have to be respect and the right to have a gun if thei wish to The problem I see is that there ar too mani gun get into the hand of children and crimin and peopl who for whatev reason ar some kind of histori of stalk or domest abus realli should not be abl to get gun I think these assault weapon ar a problem So I favor close the gun show loophol In fact I cast the tie break vote to close it but then the major in the Hous repres went the other wai that s still pend If we could get agreement on that mai be thei could pass that in the final dai of thi Congress I think we ought to restor the three dai wait period under the Bradi law I think we should toughen the enforc of Gun law so that the on that ar alreadi on the book can be enforc much more effect Some of the restrict that have been place by the Congress in the last coupl of year I think in the last few year I think have been unfortun I think that we ought to make all school gun free have a gun free zone around everi school in thi countri I think that measur like these ar import child safeti trigger lock on a mandatori basi and other Governor Well it start with enforc law and when you sai law in clear somebodi if you ar go to carri a gun illeg we ar go to arrest you If you ar go to sell a gun illeg you need to be arrest and if you commit a crime with a gun there need to be absolut certainti in the law and that mean the local law enforc offici need help at the feder level the program like Project Exile where the feder govern intensifi arrest peopl who illeg us gun and we haven t done a veri good job of that at the feder recent and I m go to make it a prioriti Secondli I don t think we ought to be sell gun to peopl who shouldn t have them as well as support instant background check at gun show One of the reason we have an instant background check is so that we instantli know whether or not somebodi should have gun or not In Texa I tri to do someth innov which is that you know there is lot of talk about trigger lock be on gun sold in the futur I support that But I said let s review if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe come and get on for free and so we ar distribut in our state of Texa for free I think we ought to rais the ag at which youth and all could carri a hand gun from to I disagre with the Vice Presid on thi issu I don t feel need for registr of gun I think the onli peopl who ar go to show up to regist and get a licens I guess licens like a driver s licens of a gun the onli peopl who ar go to show up ar law abid citizen The crimin ar not go to show up and sai hei you mean my ID card it s the law abid citizen who will do that and I don t think that s go to be an effect tool to make the keep our societi safe Right so on gun Somebodi want to cast a vote base on your differ where the differ Well I m not for registr I am for licens by state of new handgun purchas What doe that mean A photo licens ID like a driver s licens for new hand gun and you know the Lo Angele wa Excuse me you would have to get the licens a photo ID to go in and befor you could bui the gun Correct All right Who would issu that The state I think state should do that for new handgun Becaus too mani crimin ar get gun There wa a recent investig of the number in Texa who were given conceal weapon permit in spite of the fact that thei had record and Lo Angele Time ha spent a lot of ink go into that But I am not for do anyth that would affect hunter or sportsmen rifl shot gun exist handgun I do think that sensibl gun safeti measur ar warrant now Look thi is in the aftermath of column bui and peduca and all of the place around our countri where the nation ha been shock by these weapon in the hand of the wrong peopl The women who bought the gun for the two boi who did that kill at Columbin said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there she would not have bought those gun That conceiv could have prevent that tragedi Back to the question about the differ on gun control What ar thei Governor from your point view between you and the Vice Presid Well I m not for photo licens but let me sai someth about Columbin All right Thi is VOA New Now from Washington with live coverag of the US
