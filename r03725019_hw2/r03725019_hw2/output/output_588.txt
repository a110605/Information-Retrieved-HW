Thi is VOA New now in Washington I m Rai Krugel After year in power Peru s embattl Presid Alberto Fujimori sai he will resign on Mondai or Tuesdai Mr Fujimori had origin said he would remain in offic until elect could be held in April Hi latest comment to the Peruvian peopl were made in a written statement from Tokyo Thei come at a time when hi govern is enmesh in a scandal involv hi former intellig Chief Vladimir Montecino Mr Montecino wa video tape appar offer a bribe to an opposit Congressman and try to get him to support Presid Fujimori Follow the Presid s announc came word hi cabinet would resign as well British journalist Salli Bowen ha been base in the Peruvian capit for sever year and told New Now s Tom Crosbi it suddenli seem event ar move at a veri fast pace Ye it is In fact the cabinet hasn t resign all of it Well at least all the minist who ar in Peru at the moment The Foreign Relat minist is still in Panama where he is come back But basic the whole cabinet have resign And thei sai thei re indign of thi surpris decis by Fujimori Why should thei be indign about thi Why react in thi manner I think that thei feel thei have been cover hi back all the time sinc he made thi also surpris decis in the middl of Septemb to cut short hi presidenti period The economi minist said sever time you know We thought we were a cabinet come in with a new govern with new polici and we ar go to get back on track and democrat the countri and do econom reform And he said Within a month you know within six week we discov we ar an outgo cabinet Thei have kept loyal to Fujimori I mean the last few dai amid rumor that Fujimori might not come back thei have been support him and I think thei just feel veri let down I think that s the reason for the indign Indeed you note that Presid Fujimori made hi announc from Japan where he is visit And I gather from what you ar sai there is some question as to whether or not he mai return to Peru He made hi departur let s sai last Mondai wa veri unexpect He didn t inform the cabinet that he wa go until he wa on the wai to the airport He took a veri strang and circuit rout and appar drop off a larg number of box and suitcas in the Unite State on the wai And on Wednesdai on of the former opposit Congress peopl said he had hi own veri good inform that Fujimori wa not go to come back and he wa go to take polit asylum And senior cabinet minist pooh pooh thi and said that it wa irrespons rumor monger But you know it seem to have been closer to the truth than thei believ at the time Salli if he were to return would he be face some sort of possibl crimin indict or that kind of thing Not so far as we know at that moment As you probabl know there is a major investig underwai of Vladimiro Montecino hi secur advisor for the past year Indeed And Montecino ha now been charg with monei launder drug traffick corrupt of public offici a whole oh tortur and assassin to name but a few There s noth at thi moment that seem to involv Presid Fujimori with ani of those charg But obvious by implic he is at least tarnish It mai simpli turn out to be polit respons rather than crimin respons but I think you know at thi stage we don t know where the investig mai lead and there mai be more to come out Salli with the Presid announc hi plan to resign the cabinet step down as well doe thi plung the govern into chao or is there some sort of an orderli transit that should and could be take place I think it would be fair to sai that it s pretti chaotic at the moment Not chaotic in the sens that thing ar go to fall apart tomorrow and the arm forc incid have put out a communiqu sai that thei complet respect the constitution elect author and whatev thei decid so that s you know that s on element of worri or concern that we seem to be abl to forget about for the moment But the success is not clear The Vice Presid of Fujimori resign four week ago when Montecino came back So the first Vice Presid theoret is no longer in the run The second Vice Presid is a veri low profil charact and we have onli just got a new Presid to the Congress about or dai ago and I think what we ll find in the next coupl of dai is a sort of power struggl between the second Vice Presid and the Presid of Congress and probabl the opposit will prefer the latter Indeed the second Vice Presid Ricardo Marquez is quot in new report as sai he is readi to head up a transit govern He ha said that todai although he ha said or dai ago that if Presid Fujimori were to resign he would also go I think the opposit argument is that Marquez wa involv in the same illegitim elect as Presid Fujimori himself and is therefor not realli the right person to lead the transit Thei would prefer thi new and you know I think unquestion democrat and constitut Vice Presid of Congress Valentin Paneagua That s Salli Bowen a journalist who ha been base in Lima Peru for sever year talk with VOA s Tom Crosbi The US embassi in Lima sai it is not yet clear who will head the interim govern but a spokesman urg all parti to cooper to ensur what he term a peac and constitut transit The countri Congress revert to opposit control last week and lawmak have repeatedli call for Presid Fujimori s earli resign
