build a fair legal system allow free travel embrac the Internet and gradual open it polit system Clearli mani in the street seem to get the messag and some who disagre came out to wave and cheer anywai But Clinton left the countri s leader exactli where he found them bicker conflict and wonder how thei had won the war and lost the peac In a remark moment at the Communist Parti headquart in Hanoi late Saturdai afternoon Clinton plung into a spirit exchang with the countri s lead hard liner Le Kha Phieu the Communist Parti chief and the most influenti member of the Vietnames leadership Phieu had watch Clinton s nation broadcast speech to student and seen the recept the presid wa get on the street and clearli he wa fed up We have seen the collaps of the USSR Phieu said of hi countri

sector with polit sensit technolog still control by the govern One of Clinton s top advis who wit the encount said hi sens wa that the Communist Parti chief wa sai in effect There is a line We kick you gui out And now we ar go to be friendli but there is onli so far we will go The two leader argu polit over whether the Unite State had imperialist intent here Clinton told CNN on Sundai I stoutli disput that we were an imperialist countri dure the war insist that the conflict had been over what self determin for the Vietnames peopl realli meant Thei were talk about dai long past But the subtext of the discuss wa veri much about todai about Phieu s reluct to let Vietnam plung into a world and a marketplac domin by American power Contrast that convers with the on Clinton held Sundai afternoon with Vo Viet Thahn the closest thing Ho Chi Minh Citi ha to a mayor who came here as a North Vietnames battalion command help to seiz Saigon in It wa like night and dai said Sandi Berger Clinton s nation secur advis We could have been talk to ani big citi mayor in the Unite State Thahn talk proudli about all the privat sector job that had been creat in thi teem citi of motor scooter and smog and how a percent growth rate had brought the citi s poverti level down Clinton ask what the Unite State might do to help Low incom hous project Thahn immedi suggest That is a long wai from Thahn s object here year ago which wa to wipe out ani vestig of American influenc Indeed the viscer attract to the Unite State wa the big surpris of thi trip reminisc of Japan s fascin with all thing American after World War II the differ of cours be that the Unite State won that war While mani American watch snippet of the visit on televis were undoubtedli think about Clinton s effort to sidestep the draft the Vietnames saw a man who had lift the econom embargo against their countri normal diplomat relat and arriv here with a backup plane full of potenti investor The last American presid we like wa Kennedi said Do Thi La a year old shopkeep as she watch Clinton s motorcad speed past But Clinton mai have done more good thing for Vietnam There is an inevit tendenc dure trip like thi to

of Vietnam s million peopl cannot afford a telephon and have never wander into on of Saigon s chic Internet cafe So at moment the optimist talk among Clinton s aid about the inevit of econom and polit reform in Vietnam seem like an eeri echo of the dai when Robert McNamara Kennedi s defens secretari declar that everi quantit measur we have show we ar win the war Mayb thi time the leader in Hanoi have no real choic Thei don t have mani domino to plai thei don t have alli will to prop them up and to the rest of the world it make far less differ whether thei succe or fail But as the author Ward
