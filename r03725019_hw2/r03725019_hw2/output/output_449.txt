Elsewher in the Middl East the investig into thi month s deadli bomb of the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen is focuss on four men Todai s sourc close to the investig said that Yemeni investig ar explor possibl link between the suspect and Muslim milit American offici ar press for a greater role in the investig The Clinton administr want US agent to have direct access to wit suspect and evid Allen Cypru is cover the stori for the Washington Post in Aden Allen Secretari of State Madelein Albright said that the US want more access What ar US agent not be allow to do Who can thei not talk to At thi point we ar be told that FBI agent ar not allow to question possibl suspect or possibl wit In fact that there ar not even in the room when those question ar pose From the Yemeni point of view thi is a matter of sovereignti but the two side ar try to work out some kind of arrang in which American mai be abl to observ the question even if thei don t particip in it Perhap American would understand it better if it were American suspect be question by interrog from outsid Yemeni here sai that thei have been work hard to co oper with the American particularli in the face of gather evid but the Yemeni should be question by Yemeni Is it difficult at the same time for report to find out what s go on I know there ar some report who have handler or minder as you try to talk to wit is that the case with you It ha been the case all the report stai here in Aden have been assign minder from the secur servic here in Yemen and that make it a littl difficult to move around freeli and to interview peopl but by hook or by crook we sometim can get enough free space to talk to peopl And the job is not imposs but it certainli more difficult than it might be a number of other countri in the Middl East and it s more difficult than it typic is here in Yemen And when we make the American comparison again it would be hard to see how mai be the FBI or polic would stand in the wai of foreign report talk to wit here on thi end What is the rational given there There ar a number of differ rational the first on that were given is that thei ar worri about our secur thei have alreadi seen American kill here and thei don t want to see ani more incid like that but it hard to accept that at face valu More like thei ar try to control what is a sudden influx of foreign into their countri and to control the inform that come out of thi countri Are there ani new develop then as far as the suspect ar concern I mean do we know more about them or who els behind the attack on the USS Cole Not a great deal more than what we did a few dai ago The most signific statement we have heard in recent dai is that from the presid of Yemen Ali Abdullah Saleh who said that on of the suspect is believ to be an Egyptian or at least that what s the preliminari investig show We ar in the phase now of question suspect of slowli gather inform We hear report that there ar perhap peopl involv perhap peopl involv perhap more than that We hear report of multipl stai hous we hear report of investig go beyond Yemen s border to other Gulf countri But at thi point that s veri hard for us to confirm You did some interest report the dai the USS Cole left last week and you spoke with some of the peopl who were stand by the port and in some case there were certain peopl who basic bid good riddanc to it Can you tell us about some of the comment that you heard from Yemeni I should by sai I did not hear ani peopl sai that thei were happi that there had been an attack against the USS Cole But from the minut that the militari came in to follow up after the attack and the moment the FBI start arriv here there wa a great deal of apprehens among Yemeni that thi wa a secret plot to establish an American base in Yemen I think a lot of Yemeni were reliev to see the American go at thi time And in particular at a time when there is a fair bit of animos toward the Unite State becaus of it support for Israel in the current clash with the Palestinian Journalist Allen Cypru of the Washington Post speak to us from Aden in Yemen Thank you veri much for the updat Not at all thank you
