congratul kostunica but reject ani suggest that milosev stai or even wors have an offici polit role in yugoslavia i think it would be a terribl mistak for him to remain activ in the polit life of the countri that is not what the peopl vote for the u s spent billion over the last two year support the opposit but can their victori stand that could depend on whether russian still give milosev fals hope of a polit combat in moscow todai milosev s brother he sai he hi brother will not flea that he will stai that sai a foreign minist is troubl the next big question war crime milosev indict for atroc in kosovo todai the prosecutor said she s readi for him i am prepar to receiv milosev in the hagu at ani time but that is unlik a kei milosev gener rad radford rad radford rad radavan karadich also still free thei refus to turn milosev or the other over it is import for the futur of yugoslavia that thei be held account and justic be done but justic take time tonight the presid is talk to european leader about wai to lift some demick sanction on yugoslavia as earli as mondai as a strong show of support to the new govern andrea mitchel nbc new at the state depart with us for more on how thi shake out richard hass a veteran of the scounscoun in the bush white hous and an veteran of the secur council in the bush white hous well kostunica is the new name american viewer have to get us to how about a realiti check on thi gui he s obvious a lot better than the altern we have had to live with for more than a decad now but he is also a nation lift a serb nati onal lift he a serb nationalist he ha resent against america as andrea mitchel point out even if milosev were to stai in the countri thi is not somebodi that kostunica w ould gladli hand over he ha to balconi open in the unit state and europ at the same time while keep nationalist credenti he will not be someon easi to work with isn t someon somewher at the state depart perhap in the bowel of the situat room at the white hous do a quiet victori lap tonight isn t thi realli just what the u s hope and prai would happen after the bomb the sanction would work insurrect and then the leadership would toppl i hope thei don t quit do their lap yet i think it is ok to have your track shoe on but i wouldn t do ani run yet becaus what we ar see is milosev is out of offic but he ha not given up power and we still have thi end game to choreograph the idea that he would keep a major parti role that to me is worriesom becaus he could pull all sort of string behind the scene so we ar not right there to us anoth metaphor the fat ladi mai be warm up but too soon for her to be sing will he have follow yeah everi dai the secur and militari type will look at what is in the street thei will see how peopl power is go also kostunica ha to decid how hard to press it is on of the thing that make me uneasi about thi russian diplomat intervent on thing if the russian walk in and sai milosev the game is up you have to leav and then we start talk about where he goe but at end of the dai the foreign minist of russia ivanov seem to be offer him some role or space in polit and that left me a littl uneasi viewer of the presidenti debat know thi game up thi came up the other night if you ar clinton of the u s do you call putin and sai let thi be a test of our relationship and your heat as a world leader go on in here here ar the talk point let s have common ground on thi new gui i think that s the wai to go and make clear while we would welcom russian involv it is condit and it is condit that thei give milosev the right messag and the right messag is he s got to go i would sai go mean clearli out of polit i for on would be will to alou him to stai there i don t have a real problem with push the indict at thi time the kei thing is to get thi man out of polit life and let yugoslav interest constitut ultim a yugoslav court would be the right to try him yugoslav is a european countri after a certain amount of time pass i would imagin the situat would be right to bring peopl like milosev to trial i think the kei thing is to allow nation jurisdict to work after all that s our posit we ar suspici of intern tribun so long as yugoslavia were actual involv with a legitim court i think the right place to try him is by the yugoslav peopl after all thei have paid an enorm price for thi gui lift sarvings sanction is it too much of a messag or is the opposit true have the sanction been as some sai in cuba hurt the wrong peopl i think we ought to sai what the trigger would be and the trigger would be milosev out of polit life and then we can reliev sanction richard haass thank you veri much thank you brian
