larg number of Arab Afghan form into Islamic terrorist unit as hi shock troop and then reward their servic and bui their further loyalti by bring them into the big tent of hi dispar govern The FBI s concern over possibl link to the Cole bomb appear to have grown as the Yemeni investig of the bomb ha progress The Yemeni deni the FBI direct access to interrog and other kei aspect of their inquiri sai that their investig is nearli complet that it show that two beard men who attack the Cole in a fiberglass skiff were Saudi Arabian born Yemeni like bin Laden and that the most us lead in the case now lie outsid Yemen In the last week the FBI s concern were heighten by the govern s decis to open a trial probabl in Januari of half a dozen kei suspect mostli Arab Afghan who had low level govern

eventu held a trial execut the alleg conspir without give the American ani access But the Khobar Tower analog and the mere suggest that promin Yemeni might have conniv in the Cole bomb ha enrag the Yemeni Last week Prime Minist Abdul Karim al Iryani a Yale educ biogeneticist call an American report and deni ani suggest of a cover up Throughout hi tenur al Iryani ha been caught in a polit crossfir result from hi govern s desir for improv relat with the Unite State as evidenc by the agreement on Navi ship refuel in Yemen and it desir not to provok influenti Yemeni who ar militantli anti American Over the fierc resist of Yemeni secret polic the prime minist ha been negoti with the U S ambassador Barbara K Bodin for better FBI access to the Yemeni probe includ the right to have FBI agent watch Yemeni interrog through a on wai mirror or a live televis relai Until now all the FBI ha seen of the interrog ha been edit transcript In the telephon call al Iryani reiter that it is nonsens absolut nonsens to suggest that some of bin Laden s old alli in San a could have plai a part in the bomb of the Cole Refer to the Arab Afghan who settl into Yemen s remot mountain and desert in the earli s as jihadi or holi warrior he said thei had been contain sinc join the govern Ye these jihadi have help us dure the secessionist war and ye we decid that thei must be absorb into the

could conceiv have consult with high offici for the simpl reason that thei would have known that anyon who did would have been arrest immedi he said What anybodi make of all thi depend in part on the assess of Saleh on of the Arab world s longest surviv leader and hi polici of reach out to Islamic milit rather than jail and execut them as ha happen in Egypt Jordan and other Arab state Although the polici rais debat elsewher in the Arab world it is at least to some extent an outgrowth of Saleh s own turbul polit past and the Yemeni elit s histori of assassin and betray Saleh then an obscur armi offic becam presid after an armi offic coup in which on Yemeni presid Ibrahim al Hamdi wa shot dead in and a second coup eight month later in which al Hamdi s successor Ahmad al Ghashmi a close alli of Saleh wa kill by an agent of the Aden communist with a suitcas bomb That Saleh is still presid year later despit assassin attempt hi aid suggest is partli becaus he reach out to potenti enemi reward ani who step into hi big tent with govern protect and salari But the corollari is that Saleh ha made alli or at least beneficiari of men with lurid past especi the Arab Afghan Thi paid off for him when Islamic milit group alli with hi forc and enter Aden on June final reunit Yemen after centuri of divis while kill at least civilian in the process accord to Western human right report Year later the result is that the capit ha becom a hive of polit ideolog and religi contradict that were bound to intrigu U S offici investig the Cole bomb One of the most power express of thi complex situat wa that by the time Saleh negoti the agreement allow U S warship to refuel in Aden two of the most power peopl in the capit after Saleh himself were on time alli of bin Laden U S intellig report sai both these men travel to Afghanistan in the s to meet bin Laden and help recruit milit from across the Muslim world for the Afghan struggl One of them is Saleh s half brother Ali Mohsen al

through hi marriag to a sister of a promin tribal leader Tariq Nasr al Fadhli on of the lead Afghan war veteran live on a govern stipend in San a Son of on of the most power sultan in southern Yemen dure the British coloni era al Fadhli in hi mid s is said by Yemeni and U S offici to have met bin Laden in Saudi exil in the s and to have fought under him in Afghanistan Now he is a member of the

of two Aden hotel that were billet more than U S troop en rout to Somalia Those bomb also direct by bin Laden the FBI contend fail to kill ani American onli becaus a deton went off prematur disabl a huge truck bomb The man believ to have driven the truck and to have lost hi hand when the deton explod Jamal al Nahdi is said by U S offici to be live in San a as a businessman Another promin figur with long stand ti to Islamic terrorist group is a militantli anti American cleric Abdel Meguid al Zindani In hi late s al Zindani head a San a theolog school the Univers of Faith a beneficiari of

contriv to deni Western report free access watch carefulli where thei go and whom thei see The onli senior govern offici author to speak about the Cole bomb have been Saleh and al Iryani Al Iryani ask about Mohsen and al Fadhli said both men had perman sever their ti with the Arab Afghan network Meanwhil the question pose by the Cole bomb have carri U S offici back to calcul made befor the warship refuel program began Then offici like Bodin the U S ambassador had to explain to the Pentagon why it made sens to bring warship into a countri that the State Depart itself had describ as a safe haven for terrorist group or to trust a govern that had espous some sharpli anti American polici for exampl support Saddam Hussein in hi invas of Kuwait The argument that prevail in Washington wa that the Saleh govern wa chang and that it had taken import step to curb Islamic terrorist group still base in the remot part of the countri Thi is al Iryani s content and it ha strong support from U S offici here who sai thei believ that Saleh would like to curb the Arab Afghan onc and for all Yet even American who push hardest for the refuel agreement now question whether the onli assist the Cole bomber had from Yemeni came from a hand of lower level offici It wa much more complic than that and requir a lot of help from insid the countri a senior U S offici said As for who gave that help that s like try to sort out the tentacl of an octopu
