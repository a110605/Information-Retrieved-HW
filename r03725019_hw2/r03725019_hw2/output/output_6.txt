And I m Tom Crosbi and thi is VOA New now Massiv ralli ar take place in Yugoslavia in defianc of the govern s call for a second round of presidenti elect The major of the Yugoslav peopl have been support the opposit on the gener strike to protest what it leader sai wa a blatant attempt to misrepres the result of the first round of elect a week ago Most region analyst ar predict that Slobodan Milosev s dai as Presid of the Feder Republ of Yugoslavia ar number Yugoslavia in transit is the subject of todai s Datelin Here s Judith Latham Stoyan Serov a columnist with the Belgrad independ weekli Breme who is current a Fellow at the US Institut of Peac in Washington sai he wa as astonish as all the other analyst when opposit candid Vojislav Kostunica won on the first ballot against all odd But in retrospect he think the polit upset in Yugoslavia wa perhap understand It s just absolut surpris for everybodi All analyst were predict that it wa realli a huge fraud that Milosev is go to steal as mani vote as he need and that there is no wai you know to replac Milosev in the elect which mean in a democrat manner Well it seem that everybodi wa wrong and Milosev is go to lose the power He wa pretti weak alreadi Still he wa abl to stai in power and I think that he just made some miscalcul He didn t expect Kostunica he didn t expect opposit to unit Milosev wa lost he could not realli steal a million vote so he wa forc to admit thi defeat and nobodi expect that Peopl thought that well Milosev can do just about anyth I believ that there is no wai out for Milosev but to step down and I believ that s exactli what he is go to do in a next few dai or week I wouldn t exclud some surpris some attempt to complic event to us some forc So thei might try to us polic mayb even the armi but it seem to me that he is lose the back in the armi and polic probabl as well So I expect that mani of hi peopl will probabl veri soon turn their back to Milosev and I believ it is go to happen veri veri soon Stoyan Serov sai a major reason Serbian opposit wa abl to unit behind a singl candid thi time as it had not befor wa that anoth presidenti contend Serbian Renew Parti leader Woodgouskov wa outmaneuv and wa render ineffectu What Mr Serov also call kei wa the unselfish decis by the leader of Serbia s Democrat parti Zoran Djindjic to back Mr Kostunica and he add outpour the student resist movement that campaign for the democrat opposit of Serbia and courag stood up to polic brutal gain the respect of Serbian voter Balkan Analyst Overec Kasich sai he felt quit confid that the opposit would win in the Yugoslav elect but he wa amaz by the margin of victori So with over a million vote divid the two I mean that s just astronom and it wa beyond all expect and in speak with peopl from Kostunica s campaign staff thei were also extrem surpris by those result How weaken is Mr Milosev by the outcom I think that you could see the disarrai within hi own camp You could see that there is a debat rage in term of what the best strategi is It s interest to me that the first even it seem as if thei were pursu their first strategi which wa to try to steal the elect in the first round And henc the delai in report Exactli but onc it becam appar the margin the enorm margin that separ him from Kostunica then it almost becam imposs for them to do that So thei had to fall back on the secondari strategi and that s what we have now The onli thing I would stress is that it s possibl that he will chang cours onc again and will pursu a third option What option ar realist avail to him at thi point One option is to stick thi out and wait until October th and then hold a mockeri of an elect in which you know of the elector will turn out or less then proclaim victori on that basi And then basic have a crisi that extend indefinit with him hope that the opposit will not be abl to maintain the level of support thei have up until thi point and will not be abl to ralli as mani peopl into the street The second option is if he doe not want or cannot us the polic to dispers these crowd and he begin to lose support intern then he could seek an option in which he transfer the level of author to anoth function Sinc the socialist and their leftist alli control the feder parliament he could have himself appoint as Prime Minist of the feder govern So it s hard therefor to see at thi point what he would do I can tell you that he is known for chang cours in midstream if he see that there ar obstacl in hi path So we can expect just about everyth with him Now the opposit is refus to go to a second round on October th Right How riski is that strategi And what ar the pro and con for Mr Kostunica for refus to particip in a runoff elect Well on of the con is that Milosev goe ahead and hold thi elect and then you have a confront as to who is realli the legal elect Presid The danger for the opposit onli come from develop that s hard to forese now that Milosev can wear down the resolv of the opposit But in order for that to work he definit cannot resort to violenc becaus that would just harden the resolv of the demonstr and he ha to understand that he could have the same type of confront he ha now even follow the elect October th And more importantli the second round could serv as a trigger for greater demonstr and perhap even violenc In the dai ahead and I m think about the time between now and when a runoff might occur if that happen what should the intern commun do now I would advis that the intern leader especi from the Unite State and from NATO countri should maintain a low profil Everi time thei get up and make a speech in which there is a veil threat or a direct threat that help Mr Milosev becaus Milosev want peopl afraid that there will either be foreign intervent or that there would be the threat of a civil war Right now the spotlight should be on the peopl of Serbia and the opposit leader Balkan Analyst Albert Casetch is Director of Government Affair for ICN Pharmaceut He spoke with us from hi offic in Washington Greg Shelti Senior Director for South East European Affair at the Nation Secur Council sai the opposit leader know thei ve won the first round of elect in Yugoslavia To accept the second round he believ would plai into Mr Milosev s strategi of bui time If thei went through a second round I am sure thei would do even better but that wouldn t keep Milosev s Feder Elector Commiss from announc that he ha won So I think it s also a matter of what Milosev might do between now and anoth set of elect Milosev could veri easili seek to engin a crisi on the street in Montenegro wherev to give him an excus to call off the elect Thi is about whether or not Milosev will allow the will of the Serb peopl to be express to allow a transit to a democrat system And I think what the opposit ha decid to do and I think it s a wise strategi a fair strategi is to keep the pressur on Thei know thei ve won Kostunica said veri clearli in hi victori ralli that to conced to a second round would be somehow acknowledg that the regim could get awai with cheat And I think the point he is make is that he is a differ type of person and we have clear sign that within the polic and then within the militari too that there is great sympathi for the opposit and that there is recognit that the opposit ha won And I think it s veri signific For exampl the Gener in charg of the Yugoslav armi ha said that the armi will keep out of thi and I think it s particularli import that the Serb Orthodox Church ha come out and even recogn Mr Kostunica as the Presid And Milosev must be veri worri at thi point and thi is the most seriou challeng that s ever been made to hi power Greg Shelti staff member at the Nation Secur Council spoke with us from hi offic in the White Hous Yugoslavia in transit wa the subject of todai s Datelin I m Judith Latham
