propag a purist milit strident anti Western form of Islam known as Salaf which Arab and Western scholar sai is at the core of bin Laden s belief In effect Salaf is a still harder line version of Wahab the puritan form of Islam that bin Laden absorb dure hi form year in Saudi Arabia The essenc of Salaf from the Arab word salaf mean ancestor is that Muslim should shun the corrupt wai of the modern world and return to the auster and zeal of the Prophet Muhammad who di nearli year ago At Dammaj it ha becom a wai of life for at least student from all over the Muslim world particularli from nation

for hi link to a milit Islamic group that in occupi the holiest shrine in Islam at Mecca set off a showdown in which hundr were kill But not far from Dammaj there ar dozen of other sheik a titl that can also mean a tribal leader and thei repres the old Bedouin rule class that still control vast stretch of land that arc around Yemen s tens mile frontier with Saudi Arabia Resent of the th centuri

two emissari sent by bin Laden from Afghanistan where he ha been hide sinc Bin Laden s purpos it wa said wa to seek the tribal leader consent to move to Yemen a desir he acknowledg shortli befor in an interview with Al Qud al Arabi an Arab languag newspap publish in London Sheik Muhammad bin Shajea who control an area of thousand of squar mile deep in the desert along the Saudi Arabian border said in an interview at hi desert fort at Al Atfein about mile northeast of Dammaj that he wa among the tribal leader who met the emissari in the spring of at a tribal leader s home in Sana He said term were discuss for bin Laden s take sanctuari somewher in the sheik domain where the writ of the nation govern bare reach Thei call him a terrorist but that s what those in author alwai sai when thei ar challeng the sheik said We sai where is the imparti court to sai whether it s bin Laden who is the terrorist or hi enemi From our point of view he s not onli a great religi scholar he s a Yemeni even if hi nation is Saudi Arabian So for us hi presenc in Yemen would be quit natur On it face Sheik bin Shajea s candor about the offer could embarrass the Yemeni govern which ha insist that those who bomb the Cole ar part of an intern terrorist network in all probabl direct by bin Laden In an interview last week Presid Ali Abdullah Saleh said evid wa still lack to identifi bin Laden posit as respons for the bomb but other high offici said thei were person convinc base on the accumul evid that bin Laden had conceiv and direct the attack Bin Shajea said he and other sheik had deep sympathi

ha vow to proce with the border pact to end a sometim bloodi disput with Saudi Arabia that ha simmer for year but bin Shajea among other ha vow to kill ani survei team seek to demarc a new border In
