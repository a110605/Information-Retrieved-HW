Vojislav Kostunica s parti sai that final victori will be seal as soon as the Parliament make it offici Once the parliament is conven in the found session it can do the job and Mr Kostunica who is obsess devot to the law and constitut letter of the constitut would never accept ani other form on the inaugur Even then Serbia s new leader will have to make a transit whose difficulti ha not alwai been appreci elsewher in Eastern Europ that from oppos the govern to be the govern Vlatislav Sternavich advisor to the Presid elect sai he is not worri Democrat opposit of Serbia ha alreadi form a crisi team with all basic field of govern so to sai So these peopl ar now negoti actual also the formal take off And Sternavich sai the remain Milosev loyalist post no threat Who ar thei I mean thei ar basic part of the Milosev s team that ha of cours collaps and with it thei have collaps In the earli even hour the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church held an open at thanksgiv mass He appeal to Yugoslavia s armi not to oppos the will of the peopl One of the leader of the Democrat Allianc Montelo Beresich is former Chief of Staff of the Yugoslav armi He ha been in touch with the top brass and sai there won t be ani troubl from the militari Gener Beresich sai that the armi belong to the peopl and is with the peopl Accord to Beresich if ani gener were to try to us the armi against the peopl hi troop would refus to follow order The Unite State while enthusiast about the fall of Milosev ha been cautiou about hi successor Dure the elect campaign Kostunica critic Washington for it polici toward the Balkan He strongli denounc NATO action over Kosovo The provinc ha been administ by the Unite Nation for the past year and Milosev ha repeatedli sought to undermin the U N mission But todai Kostunica alli Montono Trichovich who repres the Kosovo Serb sai the chang of power in Belgrad will be good for peac in Kosovo The main differ between our polici and the polici of Mr Milosev is that we want the U N mission in Kosovo to succe while Milosev want it to fail said Tricov But if Milosev ha hi wai the Unite State will not have seen the end of him Todai he said he want to stai in polit Washington immedi reject that suggest insist that Milosev stand trial on war crime charg For The World thi is Nenad Sebek in Belgrad Actualli Washington ha been quit emphat about what it want to see in Belgrad Thi afternoon Secretari of State Madelein Albright made sure there could be no misunderstand We have made our posit veri clear and we believ in the import of account for what Milosev ha done and the import thing first is to get him out of ani posit of ani kind of power A veri import point is that Kostunica ha won Milosev ha lost Hi time is over He must go Secretari of State Albright also applaud Russia s new attitud toward Kostunica In Belgrad todai Russian Foreign Minist Igor Ivanov acknowledg the former opposit leader as Yugoslavia s new Presid Ivanov then met with Milosev at hi home in the Yugoslav capit It wa dure that meet sai Susan Woodword of the Center of Defenc studi at King Colleg London that the former Serbian strong man show how out of touch he ha been Milosev himself ha announc to the Russian Foreign Minist Ivanov todai that he will come back to normal polit except to feed elector and continu to be presid of hi parti which ha a larg number not the major of the larg number of seat in the Feder Parliament I think thi is an amaz stori in the sens that it reveal how far awai from realiti Milosev ha been for quit some year protect by peopl who would tell him what thei thought he want to know rather than what is real I don t think he ha ani option Why didn t Milosev fight Well I think Milosev did fight in the wai that he intend to name the imag we have of Slobodan Milosev in the Unite State and in the West is onli a partial imag of what the man is like It s much more an imag we have creat for ourselv Wherea Milosev himself would never have held elect if he did not believ in legitim is through normal process What he tri to do wa maneuv hi elect victori He wa will to steal some vote but it wa still import to him to be elect So he did choos to fight but he fought by try to manipul the constitut accord by try to manipul the Feder Election Commiss and it fail We have heard from the White Hous that the White Hous feel as though it is unaccept for Milosev to hold ani kind of posit of power at thi point Do we know how Kostunica feel about that I mean would he includ him in the govern Well I m glad you ve ask the question that wai becaus I think on of the thing that is veri import is thi is someth for the Serb to do and for Kostunica and hi cabinet to decid not for Washington or London or ani other to set condit which is on of the problem we mai encount over the next sever week Kostunica wa veri clear dure the elect campaign that he would not send Milosev to the Hagu that thi wa a matter for the Serb themselv to resolv Becaus he is a constitut lawyer becaus hi main emphasi throughout the campaign and sinc he won ha been on the rule of law and restor the rule of law in Serbia I can predict that he would probabl want some kind of judici hear You might even imagin a process like the Truth and Reconcili commiss that took place so successfulli in South Africa I think there is a lot to be said for have the Serb deal with Milosev themselv through their own legal system We don t know too much about the man who appear to be if not presid now on hi wai to the presid Kostunica except that he is a Serb nationalist He ha been in the past veri critic of NATO s bomb over Kosovo How much of a friend is he like to be to the Unite State He is a veri moder modest man who is veri direct There isn t anyth hidden but he doe feel veri strongli that the Serb themselv have an import histori and cultur that ha been deni them over the last or year I don t think he is anymor nationalist than the peopl that we have been support in Sarajevo in Zagreb and Pristina over the last ten year and inde it s probabl a veri good thing that he express himself as a Serb who is proud of be a Serb becaus of the task that the Serb have to go through now The hardship that thei will have to endur to bring the economi back in order to recreat a democrat system and the rule of law What we do know especi is how import democraci as a set of institut of a constitut order or the rule of law ar to Kostunica He ha be show that all week and I think that is what we will expect from him in the futur On the road to reconstruct that some of the project that you ar mention will he need Western monei mai be specif American monei to accomplish that He will need a lot of monei First of all the financi sanction ar the most difficult aspect of the sanction to lift becaus that mean rejoin the Internat Monetari Fund as all countri find at the end of war The first thing thei have to do befor thei can join the IMF and then begin to particip in normal intern econom activ includ borrow monei get World Bank loan all of the kind of credit that thei will now need for reconstruct that requir resolv the foreign debt arrear In addit to that thei will need to do a great deal of modern but for that the European Union ha alreadi publicli state that the EU is readi to provid that assist Assume that Kostunica can consolid power what doe thi mean for the Unite State and NATO mission in Bosnia and Kosovo Could the famili of those servicemen and women who ar there expect to see them home ani sooner No I think that it will make a big differ to the region It certainli will reduc the militari threat that is perceiv to be the reason for have American troop in Bosnia and Kosovo much will be good But I think that we don t realiz how much the difficulti in Kosovo and in Bosnia ar veri real Thei ar not onli a result of Slobodan Milosev the creation of new state out of the former Yugoslavia requir stabil and it will be a long time befor the polit statu of Kosovo can be decid and the difficulti within Bosnia and Herzegovina can be resolv We will need NATO troop in the region for sometim Susan Woodword is a senior research fellow at the Center for Defenc Studi at King Colleg in London It s an understat but to sai that it ha been a week of moment chang for Yugoslavia Just Mondai Slobodan Milosev wa on Nation Televis denounc Vojislav Kostunica and the opposit as western lacki who will lead the countri into war and poverti For dai the Milosev regim clung to the notion that the presidenti elect of Septemb th wa inconclus that Kostunica had not won outright and that there should be a run off elect The opposit would have none of it Thei call for a gener strike to forc Milosev to back down and accept defeat The demonstr earlier thi week turn into a popular upris when the protest storm the parliament build in Belgrad yesterdai At the end of a dai that saw tumultu scene Vojislav Kostunica told an ecstat crowd in the capit that a new Serbia had been born The old Serbia is dead said Kostunica Thi is the begin of a new life in a democrat Serbia Kostunica implor the peopl to destroi noth in the beauti citi of Belgrad and not to seek reveng either So Serbia can final becom a normal state And as we have heard from Belgrad todai the man now recogn as Yugoslavia s Presid elect ha final begun the process of put togeth
