Russian divers have found a cryptic note on the body of one of the 
sailors on the doomed Russian submarine Kursk, which sank in the Barents 
Sea. The note says at least 23 men did not die instantly. Russian 
naval officials have not released the contents of the note, but Russia's 
Etar Tass News Agency published excerpts. The agency reports that 
the note reads all the crew from the 6th, 7th and 8th compartments 
went over to the 9th because of the accident. Those compartments are 
toward the rear or aft of the submarine. The note continues, none 
of us can get to the surface and ends, I am writing blindly. The note 
was in the pocket of one of four victims retrieved from the Kursk 
and was written at least two hours after the first of two catastrophic 
explosions sank the submarine.
