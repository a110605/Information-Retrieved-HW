President Clinton continues his landmark trip to Vietnam today with 
a visit to Ho Chi Minh City, known as Saigon when it was the capital 
of US-backed South Vietnam. The associated press says residents of 
the city renamed after the communist takeover in 1975, were showered 
on the eve of the Clinton visit with pro-democracy pamphlets dropped 
by air. They were apparently delivered by a one-time South Vietnamese 
Air Force pilot who managed to buzz the city undetected in a small 
plane. Earlier, in a speech to Vietnamese students, President Clinton 
thanked the Vietnamese for helping to find the remains of Americans 
missing in action from the war. No two nations have ever before done 
the things we are doing together to find the missing from the Vietnam 
conflict. Teams of Americans and Vietnamese work together, sometimes 
in tight and dangerous places. The Vietnamese government has offered 
us access to files and government information to assist our search. 
And in turn, we have been able to give Vietnam almost 400,000 pages 
of documents that could assist in your search.
