The Bath Iron Works and its largest union tentatively agreed Friday 
on a contract that would end a six-week walkout by 4,800 shipbuilders, 
a federal mediator said. The agreement with the Machinists was reached 
after 36 hours of negotiations with mediators in Washington, said 
Elayne Tempel of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in 
Portland. Details of the agreement were not immediately available. 
The union wanted better job security and higher wages. Union members 
will vote on the contract on Oct. 22. Bath Iron Works, owned by General 
Dynamics, has 7,600 workers and builds the Aegis destroyer. It did 
not build the USS Cole, the Navy ship attacked Thursday in Yemen. 
Shipbuilders voted to strike on Aug. 27. Talks broke off last week 
after both sides reported no progress, but negotiations resumed on 
Wednesday in Washington. The shipyard's highly skilled workers feared 
that cross training would weaken the value of the specialized work 
force and lead to layoffs. The company's last offer would have boosted 
wages 3.5 percent to 4 percent each year through 2002, half the raises 
being sought by workers. The union said its average worker earns $32,000 
annually. The last strike against Bath Iron Works was a 99-day walkout 
in 1985. ___ On the Net: Bath Iron Works: http://www.biw.com Machinists
