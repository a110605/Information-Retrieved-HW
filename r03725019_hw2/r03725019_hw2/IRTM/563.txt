tonight president clinton continues a history-making visit to vietnam, 
a visit being overshadowed a bit for the fight for his successor. 
no u.s. president has gone to hanoi. president clinton wants this 
to be a step forward in recon sill combration of two old enemies. 
from jim maceda in hanoi. 25 years after the end of a wear that killed 
58,000 americans and divided a nation, bill clinton has taken a big 
step in repairing history. president clinton greeted as a friend in 
vietnam. honor guard welcomed from an army america once vowed to destroy. 
he met with vietnam's president, a top engineer during the war and 
other leaders of the former enemy of the state. with his wife and 
senator-elect hill ray and daughter chells say. a speech broadcast 
live to the country's 80 million people. clinton made no apologies 
for the american war or mernings his young eant-war days. let us continue 
to help each other heal the wonds of wars. acknowledging the cost 
of the war to the vietnamese, 3 million died. a staggering sacrifice 
to the vietnamese people on both sides. then urging reaction outside 
of the shops in hanoi are positive. i'm old enough to remember the 
war, relations are improving. the warm reception extending through 
toaststs and an even at the opera house. there were important agreements 
on science and labor laws, these overshadowed by the powerful symbol 
of the trip itself. the histories of our two nations are deeply intertwined.

service men still missing in action.
