Slobodan Milosevic's police entered a major coal mine south of here 
Wednesday to break up one of the biggest strikes launched so far to 
drive the Yugoslav president from power, an independent news agency 
said. Truckloads of police and soldiers entered the Kolubara mine 
complex after the government said the five-day strike threatened electricity 
supplies, the independent Beta news agency said. A striker who answered 
the telephone at the facility said miners were refusing to leave the 
compound and so far there had been no clashes nor arrests. He refused 
to give his name. Beta quoted a strike leader Predgrag Stefanovic 
as appealing to residents of nearby towns ``to come and help us.''
