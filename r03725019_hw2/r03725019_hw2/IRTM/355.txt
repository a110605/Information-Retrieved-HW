An army General has declared himself the winner of the presidential 
elections in Ivory Coast. General Rober Gay, the leader of the military 
hunter that rules the West African nation dissolved the commission 
that supervised the elections. Opposition leader Loron Gbagbo refused 
to accept the declaration. Based on results from its poll watchers 
Gbagbo's party had proclaimed him the winner yesterday and he reasserted 
that claim today. He called on Ivorians to take to the streets to 
support him against the hunter . Ivory Coast's two largest political 
parties had already boycotted the elections after the Supreme Court 
prevented their leaders from participating.
