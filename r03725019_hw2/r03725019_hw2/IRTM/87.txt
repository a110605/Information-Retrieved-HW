From VOA News now, Communications World, a review of electronic media 
with Dr. Kim Andrew Elliot. Welcome to Communications World for the 
weekend of October 7th 2000. In this program a look at the artistic 
side of radio and audio, including a wonderful collage of short wave 
broadcasts from the cold war era. The vestiges of the cold war have 
been playing out in the dramatic events this past week in Belgrade. 
The broadcast media were among the key objectives of the demonstrators 
who wrested control of television stations. The media in Serbia, formally 
loyal or at least obedient to Slobodan Milosevic, quickly changed 
their perspective this past week. Even the Tan Yug news agency in 
Belgrade said Thursday that it has sided with the people and will 
now report truthfully and objectively. With its short wave coverage 
presently suspended, we can't hear Radio Yugoslavia through that medium, 
my attempts to hear internet-streamed audio from Radio Yugoslavia, 
as well as from domestic radio stations in Serbia have so far been 
unsuccessful. You listeners in Europe within earshot of Serbian medium 
wave stations have a better vantage point. In fact, Khai Ludwig tells 
me that he was able to hear RTS on 648 and 1008. He said the content 
was not of any spectacular take over, rather the news and music of 
a just liberated broadcaster. Earlier this week, some employees of 
Radio Yugoslavia, the external service were fired and ejected from 
their headquarters for signing a petition calling for more openness 
in the station's coverage of the September election and by Thursday 
300 employees of Serbian State Broadcaster RTS were on strike to support 
the recognition of the opposition victory in that election. The Association 
of Independent Electronic Media in Serbia claims its satellite signal 
used to feed local television stations was jammed Thursday when it 
began reporting on the protest scenes in Belgrade.
