And right now it's time for a look at Sports. World number one women's 
tennis player Martina Hingis of Switzerland and Olympics men's champion 
Yevgeni Kafelnikov of Russia have third round matches Saturday at 
the Australian Open Tennis tournament in Melbourne. No results to 
report as yet. Now with rest of the day's Sports, here's Dave Byrd. 
A jury in Charlotte North Carolina has found former National Football 
League player Ray Karuth not guilty of the murder of his pregnant 
former girlfriend Jerica Adams. However, Karuth was found guilty of 
three other felony charges and faces as much as twenty years in jail. 
The jury's decision was unanimous. The panel was originally deadlocked 
and then was instructed to continue deliberations until a verdict 
was reached. Karuth showed no emotion Friday when Judge Charles Lamb 
read the verdict. The jury has returned. It's unanimous verdict said 
the defendant is guilty of discharging a firearm in occupied property, 
guilty of using an estimate with intent to destroy an unborn child, 
guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and not guilty of first degree 
murder. The verdict means that Karuth does not have to face the death 
penalty. Karuth was accused of planning the murder of Adams in November 
of 1999. A former wide receiver for the Carolina Panthers, Karuth 
did not fire the fatal shots. His co-defendant said he arranged the 
shooting because he did not want to pay child support.
