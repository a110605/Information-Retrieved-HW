a broader review of the "uss cole" suicide bombing. specifically, 
he wants to know if other officers in the chain of command above the 
ship's captain should be held accountable for security lapses. a navy 
inquiry under way is looking at the ship's self-protection plan. according

no one should be punished for security lapses. 17 sailors lost their 
lives in the attack.
