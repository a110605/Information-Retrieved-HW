US troops have been placed on high alert in Turkey and two countries 
in the Persian-Gulf because of terrorist threats. US officials say 
US troops at the Ensulic base in Southern Turkey, and Qatar and in 
Bahrain have been put on alert level delta, the highest state of military 
alert. Officials did not specify what threats were made, but they 
said they were based on credible intelligence information. One official 
was quoted as saying terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden is one of 
the suspects. The threats come as a massive investigation continues 
in Yemen, where an apparent terrorist attack killed 17 sailors aboard 
the USS Cole on October 12th.
