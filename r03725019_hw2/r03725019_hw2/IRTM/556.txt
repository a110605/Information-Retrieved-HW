President Clinton continues his landmark trip to Vietnam Saturday, 
with a visit to Ho Chi Minh City, know as Saigon, when it was the 
capital of US backed South Vietnam. The Associated Press says residents 
of the city renamed after the communists takeover in 1975, were showered 
on the eve of the Clinton visit with pro-democracy pamphlets dropped 
by air. They were apparently delivered by a one-time South Vietnamese 
Airforce pilot, who managed to buzz the city undetected in a small 
plane. Mr. Clinton said in Hanoi Friday, the shared suffering of war 
has given Americans and Vietnamese a relationship like no other. He 
also met with Vietnamese leaders who said they have a different interpretation 
of human rights.
