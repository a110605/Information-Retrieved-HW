A Moscow court has denied a request by US spy suspect Edmund Pope 
for a medical examination, despite his rare bone cancer. Mr. Pope's 
condition has gone untreated since he was jailed five months ago. 
Russia accuses the former US naval intelligence officer of illegally 
obtaining secrets about a high-tech Russian torpedo. On Friday the 
court denied a series of defense motions that also included a request 
to tape the proceedings and replace the court translator, who works 
for Russian security. The trial opened Wednesday and has been suspended 
until Monday.
