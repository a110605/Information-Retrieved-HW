just a couple of items overseas today. an international salvage team 
is going to raise the russian submarine that took more than 100 sailors 
to their death last summer. a very difficult operation. the international 
community will pay, about $70 million. there are 22 crue missiles 
and two nuclear reactors on board as well as all but 12 of the sailors' 
remains.
