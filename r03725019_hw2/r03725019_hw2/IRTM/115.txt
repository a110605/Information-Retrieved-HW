A team of Russian divers has flown to Norway to prepare for recovery 
of bodies from the downed Kursk nuclear submarine. The fifteen divers 
left St. Petersburg Sunday for the Norwegian port of Bergen, the base 
for the special recovery mission. The operation set to begin October 
18th is being led by Moscow and a Norwegian subsidiary of the US Oil 
Company, Haliberton. Russian authorities have yet to determine what 
caused the Kursk, one of the military's newest submarines to go down. 
The entire 118 men crew of the massive sub was killed when it plunged 
to the bottom of the Barents Sea last August.
