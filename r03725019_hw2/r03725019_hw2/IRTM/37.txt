in yugoslavia tonight, the country's highest court has annulled parts 
or perhaps all the presidential election, although the meaning of 
the ruling is not yet fully known, it could be an attempt to give 
slobodan milosevic more time. there is expected to be a mass rally 
by the opposition claiming that milosevic lost the election and it's 
time for him to step down.
