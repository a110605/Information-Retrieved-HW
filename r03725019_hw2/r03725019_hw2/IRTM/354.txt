the government said today it's going to cut back on the enormous number 
of people who descended on yemen to investigate the attack on the 
"uss cole." so many people from several agencies wanting to participate 
that the yemenis are feeling somewhat overwhelmed in their own country. 
investigats have come up with another theory on how the terrorists 
operated. abc's john miller on the house with a view. high on a hillside, 
in a run-down section of aden, the house with the blue door has a 
perfect view of the harbor. american and yemeni investigators believe 
that view is what convinced a man who used the name abdullah to rent 
the house several weeks before the bombing of the "uss cole." early 
on investigators theorized it was an inside job and much of the focus 
was on employees of the mansoon shipping company, which was under 
contract by the navy to refuel u.s. warships and would have had advance 
information about the "cole's" arrival. now the fbi believes all the 
terrorists needed to do was look out the window. to go through precisely 
the same drill, well before the "cole" arrived. the man in this house 
would have had plenty of time to signal two bombers waiting with the 
boat across the bay. investigators say clues collected over the last 
few days have already pointed them to locations both near and far 
outside the port city of aden. but they won't say there's any indication 
that the plot here goes beyond yemen's boarders. learning the true 
identities of those involved in the bombing would help answer that 
question, but the two suicide bombers died in the attack, and after 
the explosion, the man who lived behind the blue door simply vanished.
