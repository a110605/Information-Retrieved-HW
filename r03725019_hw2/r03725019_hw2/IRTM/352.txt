at the same time tonight, american troops in the persian gulf remain 
on a very high state of alert as u.s. officials continue to worry 
about what they call a very specific terrorist threat. the troops 
are stationed in bahrain and qatar across the arabian peninsula from 
yemen, where the "uss cole" was attacked. nbc's jim miklaszewski has 
the latest from the pentagon. mik? tom, the terrorist plot against 
americans throughout the persian gulf and mideast may be much bigger 
than first feared. heavily armed gunboats circle the crippled "cole"" 
in aden harbor today as u.s. forces dig in against more possible terrorist 
attacks. nbc news has learned that u.s. intelligence reports uncover 
plans for three seperate attacks against american targets in the persian 
gulf and middle east, specifically a u.s. warship, a military base 
and an embassy. in response, u.s. troops in bahrain and qatar are 
put on the highest state of alert -- threatcon delta. adm. craig quigley, 
pentagon spokesman: we thought it was simply the prudent thing to 
do, to go to that higher threat condition in those two specific areas. 
american forces at incirlik in turkey and in saudi arabia are also 
targeted and on alert tonight. u.s. embassies in qatar and jakarta, 
indonesia, thousands of miles away, are closed as a precaution. meanwhile, 
how did the suicide bombers penetrate security on the "cole." raymond 
moonie was on the deck and injured in the blast. i waved on to them 
because i thought, hey, they're friendly. the entire operation fits 
the pattern of osama bin laden who had already carried out attacks 
against american targets. one senior official is so certain they'll 
find the smoking gun that points to bin laden, he says they're already 
looking at all the options, possible missile strikes are even some 
military operation to take bin laden into custody. tom? thanks very 
much, jim miklaszewski tonight.
