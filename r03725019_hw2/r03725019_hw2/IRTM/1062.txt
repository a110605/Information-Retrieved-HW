Two weeks after a deadly earthquake in El Salvador, dozens of local 
and foreign volunteers still dig for bodies buried under mountains 
of dirt in a suburb of the capital. The grind and scrape of mechanical 
shovels and lumbering dump trucks have reverberated through the area 
since Jan. 13, when a 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook the country, 
killing 726 people, injuring 4,440 and damaging or destroying more 
than 190,000 homes. More than 850 public buildings also were damaged 
in the quake. By far the worst damage occurred in Las Colinas, a densely 
populated neighborhood in the city of Santa Tecla, 10 miles west of 
the capital, San Salvador. The landslide buried 300 homes, and local 
residents say as many as 1,000 people are still missing. ``The work 
is slow to avoid dismembering the bodies,'' said German Schleehauf, 
an official from the Guatemalan highway department. ``There is still 
a lot of work to do before the zone is completely cleaned up.'' Police 
have blocked off the area to facilitate the work. Meanwhile, health 
workers are battling to ward off epidemics and respiratory infections 
among the thousands of people, especially children, still living in 
crowded shelters. In a radio address to the nation Sunday, President 
Francisco Flores issued a call to help the victims. ``The only hope 
that the 1 million hurt Salvadorans have is that the other 5 million 
who aren't suffering will lend them a hand,'' Flores said.
