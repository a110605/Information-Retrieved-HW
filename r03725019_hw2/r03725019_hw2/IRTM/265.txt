meanwhile, the director of the fbi, louis freeh, is headed for yemen 
to personally supervise the investigation into the attack on the "uss 
cole," and some progress is being made. nbc's jim miklaszewski is 
at the pentagon tonight. with the latest for us now. tom, investigators 
tonight are still trying to figure out exactly what kind of explosive 
could cause such devastating damage to the "cole." they're focusing 
on an abandoned apartment where bomb-making materials were found. 
but today, the yemen president claims that the explosive found could 
only come from the u.s. or israel. implying that the materials or 
the weapon itself were western-made. u.s. military and intelligence 
officials cannot confirm his claim. authorities also discovered two 
yemen passports, but quickly determined they were fakes. not surprising 
to one u.s. official, who said everything in yemen's terrorist underground 
is a forgery. tom? thanks very much, nbc's jim miklaszewski at the 
pentagon tonight.
