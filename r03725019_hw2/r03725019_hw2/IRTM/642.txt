the government lawyers asked the court to impose the maximum 20-year 
sentence in prison against Mr. Pope, who was accused of stealing Russian 
military secrets. Prosecution also asked that Mr. Pope be made to 
pay more than $250 million in damages for harming the Russian defense 
industry. Details of Wednesday's court action came from Edmund Pope's
