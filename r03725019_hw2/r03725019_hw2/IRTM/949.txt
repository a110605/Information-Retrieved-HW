Four of seven escaped Texas prison inmates are in police custody and 
a fifth committed suicide Monday after police in Colorado discovered 
them living in a trailer park. The remaining two escapees are still 
at large, says FBI agent Mark Mershon. It is very important for the 
public to listen. We have two subjects who are still on the loose. 
They are armed and extremely dangerous. They're in fact heavily armed. 
We know this based upon an interview of the subjects we have in custody. 
Acting on tips from local residents, police surrounded three of the 
fugitives as they were driving from a shopping center. A fourth later 
gave himself up. The fifth man fatally shot himself in the chest after 
barricading himself inside a mobile home for several hours. No one 
else was injured. The seven escaped from a Texas State prison December 
13th. They are suspected of robbing a sporting goods store near Dallas 
on Christmas Eve and killing a police officer.
