A senior House lawmaker moved Monday to withhold proposed foreign 
aid to Yemen until the United States is assured the Yemeni government 
is cooperating in the investigation into the terrorist attack on the 
USS Cole. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations 
Committee, said the foreign aid bill now being considered by Congress 
should specify that there will be no aid ``until we have assurances 
that they are not in any way harboring terrorists and are fully supporting 
the investigation.'' Young made the statement in a letter to Rep. 
Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., who heads the Appropriations foreign operations 
subcommittee. Young and Callahan, at a meeting last April with newly 
elected Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, agreed to provide money 
for Yemen in the fiscal 2001 budget in what Young called a ``gesture 
of goodwill toward a new government that is moving positively toward 
democracy.'' Committee staffers said $4 million was included to promote 
democracy and education in the country. The official Yemeni news agency 
said Saleh had met with the head of the U.S. Central Command, Gen. 
Tommy Franks, to review military cooperation and had expressed ``his 
deep regret and sorrow for this criminal act against our country and 
against the United States of America.''
