President Clinton is on his way home from an historic 3-day visit 
to Vietnam. Before leaving Ho Chi Minh City, he told Cable News Network 
that the trend toward freedom in Vietnam is virtually irreversible. 
This country has made a lot of progress in the last few years. The 
economy is diversifying. It's becoming more open to the rest of the 
world. Sixty percent of the people are under 30 years old. Most of 
them have no memory at all of the war. Mr. Clinton said Vietnam can 
fulfill its potential and attract foreign investment only if it further 
opens up its society.
