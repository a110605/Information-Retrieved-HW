in yemen today, navy divers cut through the deck of the "uss cole" 
to remove the last four sailors who died in the attack. their bodies 
will head home tomorrow. on capitol hill today, senators were asking 
the general who sent the "uss cole" into the port of aden in yemen, 
why he made that decision. here's abc's john m wethy. the man who 
opened the door for american warships to use the port of aden made 
no apologies today. the refueling of that ship in aden was my decision. 
i want to be clear. i pass that buck on to nobody. the one question 
all of us keep hearing, why yemen? the threat conditions in aden the 
specific threat conditions, were actually better than we had elsewhere. 
general zinni said all her ports, from the suez canal to the persian 
gulf, had their own problems, either credible terrorists threats, 
unstable governments, or harbors jaed with small boats. plus, the 
government of yemen wanted better relations with the u.s. and had 
begun taking steps to control local terrorist activity. but improved 
relations, zinni gued, did not blind the u. to the risks. i don't 
want anyone to think we ever in any instance, anywhere, ever took 
a risk for the purpose of a better relationship with a country and 
put a soldier, sailor, airman or marine at risk for that reason, absolutely 
not. some republican senators wondered why the "cole" and other ships 
were not routinely taking the far safer approach of refueling at sea? 
i think i'm hearing you say, "we don't have enough tankers to be sure 
that we could do that." that's my sense, senator. the general had 
one more troubling message. terrorists are getting smarter, using 
nastier wep yauns, and as long as they are willing to die in their 
attacks, it will be virtually impossible to stop them all. john m 
wethy, abc news, the pentagon.
