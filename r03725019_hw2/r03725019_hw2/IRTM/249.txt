u.s. navy divers recovered the bodies of 6 of the 17 sailors killed 
in the apparent attack on the "uss cole" in aden, yemen. earlier today, 
the pent again had reported seven bodies were found. the investigation 
into who was behind the apparent suicide attack is being headed by 
the new york office of the fbi. two amphibious assault ships are on 
the scene to offer security and logistical help in the recovery effort. 
a third ship will arrive tomorrow along with a navy tugboat. 28 of 
the 33 wounded sailors have been released from the portsmouth naval 
hospital in virginia. and four of the most seriously wounded sailors 
are flying home from germany for additional treatment. the fbi says 
its new york office will lead the agency's investigation into the 
cole bombing. it's the same office that's investigated similar terrorist 
attacks, including those linked to ex-saudi millionaire osama bin 
laden. yesterday, afghanistan's ruling taliban denied bin laden's 
involvement in the yemeni attack. bin laden, who has been living in 
exile in afghanistan, is of yemeni descent. investigators do not say 
whether they have found a link between him and the attack, but say 
they're looking at a range of possible suspects.
