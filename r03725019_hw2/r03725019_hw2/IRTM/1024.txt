jennifer capriati finally has put all talk of her troubled past behind 
her. in spectacular fashion, the former teen progeny and seed upset 
top seeded martina hingis to win the australian open women's singles 
title. it was the 24-year-old capriati's first grand slam championship, 
coming 11 years after she burst on the scene. state of disbelief. 
so not quite yet. haven't really had a chance to just have a quiet 
moment and just think about it. so i still actually, i mean, just 
can't believe it. justin wallace, "cnn headline sports."
