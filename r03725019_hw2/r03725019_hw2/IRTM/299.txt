The Navy has changed its account of the attack on the USS Cole in 
Yemen. Officials now say the ship was hit nearly two hours after it 
had docked. Initially the Navy said the explosion occurred while several 
boats were helping the ship to tie up. The change raises new questions 
about how the attackers were able to get past the Navy security.
