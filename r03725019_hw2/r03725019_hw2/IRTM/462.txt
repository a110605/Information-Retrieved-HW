now to the terrorist bombing of the u.s.s. cole. the damage, plust 
worse than previously believed. it's in the form of new pictures obtained 
by nbc news. for the first time with the cole out of the water, the 
full impact of the catastrophic blast, clearly visible. in these photos 
obtained by nbc news, the damage much larger than first imagined. 
extending well below the water line. workers on deck, large sections 
of the hull buckled inward. a cruman sean powell back home in florida 
said inside the cole it was chaos. it got dark. we lost power. the 
ship started to list. that's what scared everybody. navy officials 
predict the coal can be repaired for about $150 million and put back 
into service. but justice department officials say in yemen, the f.b.i.'s 
investigation is dead in the water. senior u.s. officials tell nbc 
news the yemen government has all but shut down all cooperation in 
finding those behind the cole attack. evidence is either withheld 
or tampered with. a surveillance video at the harbor at the time of 
the attack was so heavily edited it didn't even show the blast itself. 
why? yemen is a terrorist hot bed. u.s. officials say some members 
of the president's own cabinet have direct ties to radical islamic 
extremists and terrorists. it's hard to see exactly why it is that 
the president there would ever want to cooperate with the rathes united 
states and possibly put himself in jeopardy. even though cooperation 
from yemen is at a stand still, u.s. officials stell nbc news they're 
making substantial progress in the investigation and are fully confident 
they'll eventually gather enough evidence to retaliate against those
