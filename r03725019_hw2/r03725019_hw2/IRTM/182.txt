Several Islamic groups are claiming responsibility for the attacks 
in Yemen on a US destroyer and the British embassy. Seventeen sailors 
died when an explosion ripped a hole into the USS Cole in the Port 
of Aden yesterday. The BBC's Barbara Platt reports. A previously unknown 
group calling itself 'Martyrs of the Oaxa Mosque Uprising' said it 
had bombed the US destroyer to defend Islamic honor and to avenge 
the blood of Palestinians killed by Israelis with America's blessing. 
Arab anger at the high Palestinian death toll and overwhelming Israeli 
force is also directed at the United States, which is seen as biased 
towards Israel, and Britain is often associated with American policies 
here. A second group called 'Mohammed's army' said it carried out 
both the ship and the embassy attacks and that it planned to bomb 
all US and British embassies. Barbara Platt in Aden.
