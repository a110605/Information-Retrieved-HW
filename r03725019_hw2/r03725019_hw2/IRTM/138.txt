this has been a day of sudden and unexpected crises, tragic and maddening 
and far from resolved. the middle east, again, ground zero for stunning 
violence. off yemen, an american destroyer was attacked by terrorists 
in the port of aden, and tonight the casualties still are being counted. 
in israel, the worst rage and violence yet in the west bank. this 
explosion in front of a police station as israelis strike back after 
the death of two of their soldiers.
