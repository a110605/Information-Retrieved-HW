The United States has issued a worldwide caution to Americans warning 
of possible terrorist threats. No threats are specified but the US 
embassy in Rome was closed Friday for what officials called security 
reasons. The embassy could reopen as early as Monday. The State Department 
periodically issues worldwide cautions. One was issued last October 
following the deadly terrorist bombing of the USS Cole Navy destroyer 
in Yemen.
