this debate begins in the shadow of a missouri tragedy. last night, 
just about this time, the democratic governor of missouri died in 
a plane crash with his son and an aide. governor mel carnahan was 
running for the senate this year, and his death puts in very sharp 
perspective how tight the overall race for control of the senate is. 
here is aaron brown. the plane crash that claimed the governor's life 
has left my surnia state of mourning and the political establishment 
in a state of shock. the governor's opponent in the election, john 
ashcroft, suspended his campaign, a close and nasty one that will 
be played out to the end because carnahan's end will remain on the 
ballot. but the crash may have ended the decrat's slim chances of 
taking control of the u.s. senate on election night. they needed a 
good night they needed to halt some of their own seats like in new 
york and they really needed to pick off these vulnerable incumbents, 
including ashcroft. to win the senate, the democrats need to pick 
up five republican seats. the best chances, beating grahams in minnesota, 
roth in delaware, gordon in washington and taking florida where a 
republican is retiring. on the other hand, republicans seem certain 
to win a democratic seat in nevada. and may well win one in virginia 
as well. the odds which were never good for the democrats, have grown 
very long, indeed. to get the senate back now, democrats have to run 
the table. when every contested race. when the with the race so closhgs 
that's almost impossible. it may turn out that the only way they can 
take control of the senate is to lose the white house. then joe lieberman 
would remain democratic senator joe lieberman one crucial democratic 
seat in the closest battle for control of the senate in 40 years.
