President Clinton, encouraged by the breakthrough in efforts to bring 
Palestinians and Israelis together for peace talks, was awaiting word 
from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on convening a summit, White 
House officials said Saturday. ``It's obviously very promising and 
the president will be in touch with leaders in the region today as 
we travel to the West Coast,'' White House Press Secretary Jake Siewert 
told reporters. ``What we are going to do is reach out to President 
Mubarak who ... has been working to arrange the summit.'' Clinton, 
who planned a political trip to Denver and Seattle, has been working 
for the last eight days to end the crisis in the Middle East and find 
those responsible for the apparent terrorist attack Thursday on a 
U.S. warship in Yemen that killed 17 American sailors. He canceled 
a political trip to Missouri and Arkansas on Friday and stayed at 
the White House to conduct telephone diplomacy with Mideast leaders. 
Aides said Clinton could travel to the region as early as Monday for 
a proposed summit intended to end the violence and get peace negotiations 
back on track. ``The summit has been proposed by Mubarak. We're awaiting 
word from President Mubarak as to whether he feels the conditions 
are in place to convene a summit,'' an administration aide said, speaking 
on the condition of anonymity. Mubarak said he would host talks in 
the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh ``as long as it serves the Palestinian 
interest,'' the Middle East News Agency reported. Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat, who had been refusing to take part until Israel vowed 
to stop firing at Palestinian demonstrators at flashpoints in the 
West Bank and Gaza, agreed early Saturday to attend. U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan was in touch with Clinton and Secretary of State Madeline 
Albright during the night and said the peace talks could be convened 
Sunday or Monday without preconditions. ``We are encouraged by what 
Kofi Annan has said,'' the White House aide said. The president worked 
late Friday night to break the Mideast stalemate, but took a break 
shortly after 9 p.m. EDT to call those gathered in Little Rock, Ark., 
for a Democratic fund-raiser. He told them he remained hopeful for 
a breakthrough. On Friday, the president spoke by telephone three 
times to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah. He also called U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, King Mohammed VI of Morocco, British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Clinton 
also talked to Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh about Thursday's 
explosion that tore a hole in the side of the USS Cole. Additionally, 
he spoke with Adm. Vernon Clark, the chief of naval operations; Adm. 
Robert Natter, commander in chief of the US Atlantic Fleet; Vice Adm. 
Charles Moore, commander of the 5th Fleet; and Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, 
commanding officer of the Cole. Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, 
interrupted his presidential campaign to attend a two-hour National 
Security Council meeting where Clinton was briefed on the volatile 
situation in the Middle East and the attack on the U.S. Navy destroyer. 
Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh were also 
at the meeting. ``Even if the violence stops it will be very difficult 
to move on to the negotiating table immediately,'' Siewert said. ``Some 
sort of cooling-off period needs to occur before they can sit down 
and work through their differences.''
