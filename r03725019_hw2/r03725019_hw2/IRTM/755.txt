authorities are releasing new sketches of seven escaped texas criminals 
and widening their search for them. the irving, texas police department 
is posting the pictures on their website -- www.irvingpd.com. police 
are also following up on 1,000 tips, including simultaneous sightings 
in four states. they say two of the convicts were spotted at a bank 
in san marcos, texas, yesterday. the convicts broke out of state prison 
december and are accused of killing a dallas-area police officer during 
a christmas eve robbery. police say the men are heavily armed. we 
don't want to have anything out there that's going to unduly stress 
out the general public and the citizens. again, these people are definitely 
armed and dangerous. we don't want people to approach them. we want 
the calls and the tips to come in. i'm not going to go in depth on 
exactly what type of weapons, but there were numerous weapons taken 
from the sporting goods store. domino's pizza is doing its part to 
help in the search. stores in the dallas area are putting pictures 
of the escapees on pizza boxes. tomorrow, the television show "america's 
most wanted" will release more information and images, including photos 
and prison videos.
