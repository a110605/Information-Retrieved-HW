Gov. Mel Carnahan's widow declared Monday she will accept appointment 
to Missouri's U.S. Senate seat if voters pick him over Republican 
incumbent John Ashcroft next week. Jean Carnahan, 66, has never run 
for or held public office but was offered a Senate appointment by 
Gov. Roger Wilson if Missouri voters choose the governor who died 
in an Oct. 16 plane crash. ``With the support of my family and an 
abiding faith in a living God, I've decided to do what Mel would have 
wanted us to do ... to continue the fight for his ideals,'' said Mrs. 
Carnahan, standing on a back porch at the family farm in Rolla. Mrs. 
Carnahan's announcement came two weeks to the day after Carnahan, 
66, the Carnahans' eldest son, Roger, 44, and Carnahan adviser Chris 
Sifford, 37, died when a small plane piloted by Roger Carnahan crashed 
outside St. Louis on the way to a campaign rally. Relatives stood 
behind Mrs. Carnahan at the announcement, which she said followed 
days of consultation with her family. ``A vote for Mel Carnahan is 
a vote they can make,'' she said. ``They still have a choice.'' Media 
polls taken after Mel Carnahan's burial showed the Senate race still 
statistically tied, as it had been for months. But the polls showed 
Mrs. Carnahan leading Ashcroft slightly when participants were told 
about Wilson's offer to appoint her senator.
