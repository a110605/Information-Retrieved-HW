in afghanistan, there are growing fears the u.s. could retaliate for 
the "uss cole" bombing if it links suspected terrorist osama bin laden 
to the attack. nic robertson has a rare look from inside the country 
where bin laden is based. abdul hai could be milling flour anywhere 
in afghanistan. his poverty stricken existence mirrored by millions 
of other afghans. their everyday lives a struggle against the devastating 
effects of more than 20 years of continuing conflict. he is grateful, 
he says, to the united states, who provide the wheat he grinds, but 
in his simple grasp of world events warns if they attack us they attack 
our religion. we will tear them apart. look what happened to the rugds 
invasion, he adds. god tore them apart. however most talk is about 
the drought destroying their crops that their country harbors those 
accused of international terrorism is they say beyond their control. 
a joke, to consider anyone other than the taliban leader is in charge. 
"osama bin laden has endeared himself to leader mullah omah," he says, 
"by giving him lots of cash. that's why he can roam this country." 
nearby in the country's spiritual capital where mullah omah's influence 
to shape events is most marked, fears of trouble ahead are growing. 
downtown, government restrictions make filming difficult and people 
guard their thoughts cautiously. what worries them, however, is that 
if the united states links the attack on the "uss cole" to afghanistan, 
then a more wide-ranging attack than the 1998 strikes that targeted 
bin laden's bases could affect them this time. nic robertson, cnn,
