the death toll from last week's devastating earthquake in india continues 
to climb, and the hope of finding survivors continues to fade. kasra 
naji reports. international search and rescue teams are finding fewer 
and fewer survivors. this team of british rescue workers were about 
to give up and leave when they found another survivor. the chances 
of finding many more people alive under the rubble is very slim now. 
among those found alive today were a young woman and her 1-year-old 
baby. they were pulled out alive from under the rubble in the city 
of ahmadabad, four days after the quake. amazingly, both were relatively 
unhurt. in another town, a 75-year-old woman was pulled out alive 
why the russian rescue team. a 16-year-old boy was rescued also. in 
many areas, rescue workers are focusing their efforts on recovering 
the dead. here, soldiers are calling on the crowd to clear the area 
for that work to begin. many bodies have decomposed. this man is spraying 
disinfection tant. thousands are still buried under the rubblervivors. 
food, water and medicine are badly needed. international aid is arriving. 
this plane arrived at ahmadabad airport earlier today. it brought 
with it tents and blankets from pakistan. such is the extent of the 
disaster that the need to help transcends decades of hostility. this 
is a gesture of good will and sympathy. history has also been a casualty. 
many ancient temples, mosques and monuments have been damaged. 113-year-old 
museum has been completely destroyed. india has yet to count the cost 
of this earthquake. kasra naji, cnn, new delhi.
