the following a grim story out ofussia tonight where there's proof 
some of the sailors on board that russian nuclear submarine the kursk 
initially survived the explosion that sank the sub, only to be trapped 
later. one of the sailors wrote a letter during those terrible final 
hours. today, 10 weeks after a mysterious accident sent the kursk 
to the bottom of the barents see, a grisly discovery. in the pocket 
of one of the crew, a handwritten note, dying words of a sailor trapped 
alive in the sunken sub. he is this lieutenant captain, seen here 
three years ago aboard the kursk. his last words tell a chilling tail 
-- tale of a desperate but future ill attempt toscape. it now appears 
23 survived -- survived the initial explosion. the 23 frantically 
scrambled to the rear of the sub. they find thescape hatch flooded 
and seal themselves in compartment nine. realizing he will die, he 
begins to write. he addressed the letter to his wife, olga. he is 
my dear, dea beloved. i want to see him again, read his letter. the 
chilling account raises new questions and criticisms of the russian 
navy, which waited several days before attempting to launch any rescue 
mission but navy officials here at the pentagon say any rescue attempt 
would have failed, that there really was no hope for the 23 survivors. 
it's believed they would have frozen to death in hours, long before 
they ran out of air. that may be little consolation for the families.

here. coming up tonight at 10:00 p.m. eastern, a closer look at the 
kursk and similar disasters that have taken place at sea.
