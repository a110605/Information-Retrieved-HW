President Clinton urged Israelis and Palestinians to undertake an 
immediate cease-fire after a new outbreak of bloodshed and called 
on both sides to condemn all acts of violence. ``Now is the time to 
stop the bloodshed, to restore calm, to return to dialogue and ultimately 
to the peace process,'' the president said Thursday afternoon in the 
White House Rose Garden. The president spoke after a Palestinian mob 
killed two Israeli soldiers in the West Bank town of Ramallah, and 
Israel retaliated with a rocket attack on Yasser Arafat's residential 
compound, Palestinian police stations and broadcasting centers. ``I 
strongly condemn the murder of Israeli soldiers in Ramallah today,'' 
the president said. ``While I understand the anguish Palestinians 
feel over the losses they have suffered, there can be no possible 
justification for mob violence.'' The two soldiers were the latest 
casualties of two weeks of violence that has left more than 90 people 
dead. ``I call on both sides to undertake a cease-fire immediately, 
and immediately to condemn all acts of violence,'' Clinton said. The 
president went before television cameras after consulting with Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. 
``The alternative to the peace process is now no longer merely hypothetical,'' 
Clinton said. ``It is unfolding today before our very eyes.'' The 
Palestinian-Israeli violence was not the only crisis confronting Clinton. 
An apparent suicide bombing in the Middle East tore into a U.S. Navy 
destroyer Thursday, killing four Americans, injuring three dozen and 
leaving 12 missing, the Defense Department said. The attack occurred 
while the ship was docked in the Arabian Peninsula and was being refueled. 
``If, as it now appears, this was an act of terrorism, it was a despicable 
and cowardly act,'' Clinton said. ``We will find out who was responsible 
and hold them accountable. If their intention was to deter us from 
our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East, they 
will fail, utterly.''
