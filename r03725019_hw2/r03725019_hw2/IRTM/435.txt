Russia has paid tribute to the 118 sailors killed in the August sinking 
of the Kursk nuclear submarine. As divers retrieve more bodies from 
the wreck on the bottom of the Barents Sea. The bodies of four sailors 
were recovered last week and on Sunday, four armored cars carried 
those remains through the military town of Severodvinsk to a memorial 
service. Russian Defense Minister, Igor Sergaev, paid tribute to the 
submariners during a ceremony while asking those gathered for forgiveness. 
Russians Vladimir Putin did not go to Sunday's ceremony, but instead 
attended a service in Moscow for more than 80 people who died last 
week in a military plane crash in neighboring Georgia.
