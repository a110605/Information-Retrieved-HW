a development to report in the struggle for power in yugoslavia. the 
country's constitutional court today annuled parts of the election 
that president slobodan milosevic had lost. it's unclear if they are 
calling for another election or just a recount. but the opposition 
candidate here, vojislav kostunica says he is concerned that it's 
all some kind of a trick for milosevic to buy himself time in power. 
vojislav kostunica has given milosevic until tomorrow to step down. 
that's when as as hundreds of thousands of anti-milosevic protesters 
are expected to converge on belgrade.
