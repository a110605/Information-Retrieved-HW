This is VOA News Now coming to you from Washington. I am Tony Riggs. 
Here's more on our top story. After three consecutive cold nights, 
hopes of finding any more people alive in the rubble left by Friday's 
deadly quake in India are fading. But there are still occasional reports 
of lucky survivors. The latest is of a four year old boy. He was found 
alive after being buried under the rubble for more than three days. 
But rescue workers say they fear they will have to amputate a limb 
to get him out. A member of a British rescue team told Reuter's news 
agency, they have asked for surgeons to perform the amputation. The 
boy's brother was already dead and their mother died beside him soon 
after the rescuers arrived.
