An apparent attack on a US warship has left at least six American 
sailors dead and about 35 injured. The explosion came as the guided-missile 
destroyer USS Cole was refueling at a port in Yemen. NPR's Chad Pergram 
reports. Both the White House and the Pentagon said the attack appeared 
to be an act of terrorism. President Clinton immediately whisked to 
the region investigative teams from the FBI, the Pentagon and the 
State Department. The attack comes as US forces in the Middle East 
have been placed on a heightened state of alert after days of clashes 
between Israelis and Palestinians. Defense Secretary William Cohen 
said the US would continue to protect its interests around the globe. 
No one should doubt our resolve to remain a force for peace and for 
stability and no one should assume that they can force us to retreat. 
No one should assume they can attack us with impunity. The Cole had 
just arrived in the harbor for a refueling stop. Officials say men 
aboard this small boat had been assisting the Cole with mooring lines 
just before the blast. Chad Pergram ,NPR News, Washington.
