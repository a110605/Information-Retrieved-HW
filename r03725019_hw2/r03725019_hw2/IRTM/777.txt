The Washington Post newspaper reported Sunday that the officer overseeing 
the Navy probe of the terrorist bombing of the US Navy destroyer Cole 
has concluded that no one should be punished. Admiral Robert Nader 
reportedly rejected the conclusion of a lower ranking investigating 
officer that better security precautions could have mitigated the 
effects of the explosion. That October 12th bombing in the Yemeni 
port of Aden killed seventeen sailors and wounded thirty-nine.
