the final presidential debate. we begin tonight with the navy's service 
for the victims of the terrorist attack on the "uss cole" in yemen, 
a service of melancholy determination. nbc's kelly o'donnell in norfolk, 
virginia. today in norfolk, against a sea of white uniforms, 5,000 
gathered to honor the fallen sailors. we lost part of america. a part 
of ourselves. the scars of that faraway blast was so visible here, 
on faces. we feel the hurt. on stretchers carrying the wounded -- 
we feel the tears. on the hearts of families whose grief is still 
beyond consoling. we mourn their loss, celebrate their lives. we know 
we will never know them as you did, or remember them as you will, 
the first time you saw them in uniform, or the last time you said 
"good-bye." but this gathering will let the nation know their sacrifice 
-- the 17 fallen sailors of the "uss cole" who left home from this 
port in august never to return. death snatched them away in one violent 
unsuspecting moment, while they were making sure that the american 
people and our friends moved easily in a dangerous world. this was 
a time for comfort and tears, but also the promise of retaliation 
to those who attacked them, we say , you will not find a safe harbor. 
a pledge that gives reassurance to her husband who's still on the 
"cole." i want them found and i want them punished for the fullest 
extent of the law, because it was cowardly and those men and women 
didn't deserve to die the way they did. this ways a day of grief for 
these sons and daughters, who stood for freedom so far from home.
