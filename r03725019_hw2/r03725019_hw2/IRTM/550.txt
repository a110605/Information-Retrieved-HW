For years, Russians have complained about politicians who pepper their 
speech with puzzling terms derived from English or Latin, words like 
``keeler,'' ``defolt,'' and ``impeech'' _ or ``killer,'' ``default'' 
and ``impeach,'' as they're better known to native speakers. Others 
bemoan the gangster-style talk of Russians, from the working classes 
to public figures, who litter their language with unprintable swear 
words. Now a group of lawmakers in Russia's parliament wants to outlaw 
both kinds of talk: The 12 legislators have proposed a bill that would 
mandate the use of Russian words instead of imports and make the use 
of swear words in any public comments a criminal offense. It is unclear 
how wide-ranging the bill would be, and whether it would apply to 
everyone or just politicians and the media. But under the bill, politicians 
talking about defaulting on debts would have to say ``nevypolneniye 
obyazatelstv'' instead of taking the common foreign shortcut, ``defolt.'' 
And references to the new ``millennium'' would be replaced by the 
Russian word, ``tysyacheletiye.'' The text of the draft has not been 
published yet, but excerpts were provided to The Associated Press 
by one of authors, pro-Kremlin Unity Party lawmaker Alexei Alexeyev. 
``Unfortunately, there are no legal norms in our current legislation 
on the purity of the Russian language'' _ an oversight that the bill 
proposes to fix, Alexeyev said Thursday. The legislation was proposed 
by Unity but also backed by several of parliament's Communists, who 
are known for a nationalist dislike of imports, linguistic or otherwise. 
The bill may have a hard time winning wide backing in the house, called 
the State Duma, where many lawmakers themselves resort to foreign 
or unprintable words in private, and occasionally public, conversation. 
But the proposal highlights some Russians' growing concern about the 
state of the language of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. And it comes amid 
increasing threats to the language's eminence in former Soviet republics 
outside Russia, where long-suppressed local tongues are taking over. 
Almost daily, Russian newscasts show politicians talking about reaching 
``konsensus'' (instead of ``soglasiye,'' the Russian word for ``agreement''); 
about the Communists' ``impichment'' attempt against ex-President 
Boris Yeltsin; about the government's ``defolt'' on foreign loans 
_ all words that were once alien to the Russian ear but recently have 
pushed their way into everyday conversation. Even the Russian word 
for ``murderer'' is often abandoned in favor of the English-derived 
``killer,'' pronounced ``keeler.'' Many prominent government and public 
figures are notorious for mangling Russian's complex grammar. President 
Vladimir Putin himself could become a target of the bill: He is known 
to resort to rough speech at times, and at least once crossed publicly 
into the unprintable. Speaking to families of the sailors killed in 
the sinking of the submarine Kursk, he used an obscenity that prompted 
him to add: ``May the women forgive me.'' The lawmakers' effort is 
not the first crusade for the Russian language. A popular Russian 
radio station runs a brief program that highlights frequently mispronounced 
Russian words and tells listeners how to say them correctly. The Academy 
of Science's Institute of the Russian Language has set up a free telephone 
service for callers who want to know how to spell or use a difficult 
word. And the Russian Press Ministry has set up a literacy Web site 
with dictionaries and a survey of common language mistakes in the 
Russian media. ``Language is not simply a communication tool, but 
a creative force that forms, preserves and modifies the national perception 
of the world,'' the site says. Regulating the ``national perception 
of the world'' was something Soviet-era propaganda once excelled in. 
But in today's Russia, where state control over everything from speech 
to public dress is largely a thing of the past, the lawmakers' proposal 
has been received with humor rather than apprehension. Punishment 
for violators of the proposed language law has not been specified 
yet, Alexeyev said. He said the authors are still putting finishing 
touches on the document.
