The US State Department is warning Americans to take precautions against 
possible terrorist attacks in the Persian Gulf region, the Arabian 
Peninsula, and Turkey. NPR's Ted Clark reports. The department says 
it has information that terrorists might be planning operations against 
US interests or US citizens in these areas. No details were provided. 
The department urges Americans to avoid large crowds and to keep a 
low profile in Turkey, the Gulf, and the Arabian Peninsula. They should 
vary routes and times for all required travel, the department says, 
and treat mail from unfamiliar sources with suspicion. Tensions in 
the Middle East have increased sharply because of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian 
clashes and last week's attack on the USS Cole. Ted Clark, NPR News,
