sunken submarine "kursk." it took the divers five days to cut through 
the 16-inch hull. so far three bodies have been found. the nuclear-powered 
sub sank on august killing 118 russia sailors experts say the recovery 
may be long, risky and expensive. at least six more holes will have 
to be cut into the sub to allow access to each sealed-off compartment.

to have proof within the next two months.
