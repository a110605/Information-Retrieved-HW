Sue Weber supported Mel Carnahan for Senate. She still does, even 
after his death in a plane crash nearly two weeks ago. ``He was a 
great man,'' said Weber, whose commitment to vote for the late Democratic 
governor drew a smile and shake of the head Friday from Larry Weber, 
her husband of 35 years. ``Why people would go ahead and vote for 
someone deceased is beyond me,'' said her husband, who has been backing 
Carnahan's opponent all along. The candidate is dead, but the Carnahan 
campaign is still very much alive. Not only is his name still on the 
Nov. 7 ballot _ it was too late to remove it _ but polls taken after 
his burial show Carnahan still locked in a too-close-to-call race 
against Republican Sen. John Ashcroft. Nationally, at least two people 
have won election to the House posthumously, but it appears no senator 
has ever been elected after death. Carnahan, 66, his 44-year-old son 
Roger and a campaign adviser died in the Oct. 16 crash of a small 
plane Roger Carnahan was flying to a campaign rally. Since then, Missouri 
Democrats have issued bumper stickers and buttons with the slogan 
``Still for Mel!'' and put out the word that a vote for Carnahan is 
a way to honor the memory of the popular governor and is tantamount 
to putting his widow, Jean, in the Senate. Mrs. Carnahan, 66, who 
has never run for office, said she will talk to her family this weekend 
and announce Monday _ eight days before the election _ whether she 
will accept Gov. Roger Wilson's offer to appoint her to the Senate 
if her late husband outpolls Ashcroft. ``I still believe deeply in 
the cause for which my husband lived and died,'' she said. ``These 
shared values are a permanent part of my being.'' Mrs. Carnahan would 
serve until the next general election, in November 2002. Many voters 
weren't waiting for her decision to declare their loyalty to her husband 
of 46 years. ``Any Democrat who fills the seat is better,'' said John 
Rogers, 34, a lawyer in St. Louis. Arnie Fagan, owner of Cool Stuff, 
a store in Columbia that sells beads, incense and ice cream to college 
students, said he has seen no squeamishness about voting for a dead 
man. ``Hey, if these kids who feel so powerless are told they can 
vote for a dead statesman who stood for something instead of a live 
politician from Washington, I think Carnahan wins,'' Fagan said. A 
poll published Friday in The Kansas City Star showed Carnahan still 
in a tie with Ashcroft. The Mason-Dixon poll taken on Monday and Tuesday 
_ following Carnahan's funeral _ gave the men 46 percent each, with 
a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The pollsters 
also explained to voters Wilson's plan to appoint Carnahan's widow. 
With the additional information, Carnahan's support rose to 47 percent, 
with Ashcroft at 45 percent, a difference that is not significant 
statistically. During a campaign stop in Springfield, Ashcroft wouldn't 
discuss the poll. A former two-term governor, Ashcroft said: ``I'm 
going to work real hard to talk to people about the issues and the 
experience I have. I believe the people will respond positively.'' 
At the Democratic Party office in Columbia, workers said they had 
handed out more than 400 Carnahan signs since his death. Doris Hawkins, 
69, a retired teacher, said she had no political signs in her Columbia 
yard before Carnahan died. On Friday, she walked into the office and 
picked up the only sign left bearing Carnahan's name _ a party pitch 
for Carnahan, Gore-Lieberman and gubernatorial candidate Bob Holden. 
``My next-door neighbor is a Republican and I want to agitate him 
a little bit,'' she said with a laugh. ``Of course I will vote Carnahan.'' 
Sue Weber will, too. She said she has confidence in Mrs. Carnahan. 
Larry Weber replied that Ashcroft has a record and is available to 
hold to his promises if re-elected. ``We know what Ashcroft stands 
for,'' he said. ``I don't want to elect a mystery.'' ___ On the Net:
