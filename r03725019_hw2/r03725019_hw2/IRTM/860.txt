The former head of Peru's armed forces says the country's former Intelligence 
Chief Vladimiro Montesinos plotted a coup last year to overthrow then 
President Alberto Fujimori. Retired General Jose Vilonuaeva said late 
Sunday Mr. Montesinos had approached him about ousting Mr. Fujimori 
and replacing him with former Economy Minister Carlos Balonia. General 
Vilonuaeva says Mr. Montesinos wanted to remain Peru's De facto leader 
after Mr. Fujimori dismantled the National Intelligence Service. Mr. 
Fujimori also cut short his Presidency after a bribery scandal involving 
the spy chief last September. The General says he refused to support 
the proposed coup.
