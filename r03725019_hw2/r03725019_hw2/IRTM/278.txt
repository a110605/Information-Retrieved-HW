the nuclear submarine "kursk" could become a permanent underwater 
grave for 118 russian sailors. russia's top admiral says he may scrap 
efforts to recover the bodies if experts decide the mission would 
endanger deep sea divers. all those aboard the "kursk" were killed 
in august when the sub sank after being damaged by an explosion in 
the barents sea. the cause of the disaster has not been determined. 
an international salvage team is due to arrive at the scene of the 
accident tomorrow.
