Police battled demonstrators Thursday and black smoke billowed from 
parliament after security forces drove off mobs trying to storm the 
building to demand Slobodan Milosevic accept electoral defeat. Clashes 
spread through the streets of the capital, which echoed with the sound 
of stun grenades and tear gas fired to break up the crowds. Dozens 
of people were injured, according to witnesses. The melee erupted 
at the start of a huge rally the opposition called to force Milosevic 
to accept electoral defeat by Vojislav Kostunica in the Sept. 24 election. 
In what was apparently the largest anti-Milosevic protest since his 
13-year rule began, hundreds of thousands of people had assembled 
less than an hour before the rally was to begin, and tens of thousands 
more were seen streaming into the city. Opposition leaders attempted 
to rally the crowd, blasting rock music through the capital and calling 
for nonviolence. An opposition leader told the crowd that Kostunica 
would address the rally ``from inside'' parliament. The melee began 
when angry protesters charged the parliament building, pelting the 
doors with stones. Riot police responded with tear gas as the protesters 
broke through a police cordon and reached the parliament doors. Police 
had already fired tear gas at a group of protesters who tried to push 
their way into the domed building earlier in the afternoon. ``At this 
moment, terror rules in Belgrade,'' the pro-Milosevic government television 
said in a commentary. ``They are attacking everyone they see on the 
streets and there is chaos.'' A reporter at the scene saw at least 
five injured protesters lying on the steps of parliament. One policeman 
caught by the crowd was beaten. Several policemen deserted their cordon 
and joined the protesters, reporters at the scene said. Five police 
cars were set afire in the front of the parliament.. Tensions were 
rising after the Yugoslav Constitutional Court issued a ruling that 
one justice reportedly said nullified the recent election. The opposition 
claimed the decision by the pro-Milosevic court was aimed at prolonging 
his stay in power. By early afternoon, downtown Belgrade was a mass 
of people, many streaming toward the parliament building and blocking 
traffic as they did so. People in the crowd waved flags, shouted and 
jostled each other in the streets. Many wore paper caps with the slogan, 
``We'll Endure.'' They moved past shops, some shut down with signs 
stating, ``Closed because of Robbery'' _ an allusion to opposition 
claims that Milosevic stole the elections. Thousands more people joined 
smaller rallies in towns throughout the country. In the third largest 
city, Nis, about 10,000 people tried to push their way into the local 
office of Milosevic's party but were persuaded by opposition leaders 
not to give police a reason to attack them. The government acknowledged 
that Kostunica outpolled Milosevic but says he fell short of a majority 
in the five-candidate race. A run-off had been set for Sunday. Late 
Wednesday, the constitutional court, in a brief dispatch by the state-run 
Tanjug news agency, said ``part'' of the Sept. 24 election had been 
annulled. There was no comprehensive statement from the court. But 
one justice, Milutin Srdic, told Radio Free Europe that the entire 
election result had been thrown out and a new vote would be required. 
In the meantime, Srdic said Milosevic could remain in office through 
his term, which expires in July. The opposition said it had not been 
officially notified of the ruling. However, opposition legal expert 
Nebojsa Bakarec dismissed the decision as the latest ``in a series 
of unconstitutional moves'' by Milosevic ``to manipulate the electoral 
will of the people.'' The United States, Britain and other Western 
governments condemned the apparent move to extend Milosevic's tenure. 
``The people of Yugoslavia have made their will known: Milosevic should 
not thwart them,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in Egypt. 
In what the opposition hoped was a further sign the regime was crumbling, 
more than 160 employees of Serbian state television _ a major pillar 
of Milosevic's power _ were fired Thursday after going on strike. 
Most were technicians and staff of nonpolitical programs. Most Milosevic 
loyalists remained, and kept the network on the air. Police had set 
up roadblocks outside Belgrade, but the convoys of protesters were 
so large that most of them were allowed to pass. A convoy of about 
2,000 people was briefly blocked near the town of Smederevska Palanka, 
about 30 miles south of Belgrade, but it eventually pushed its way 
through barricades. Protesters used a front-end loader to shove aside 
two sand trucks used by authorities to try to block a 12-mile line 
of cars and buses with about 15,000 people traveling from the opposition 
stronghold of Cacak. Riot police stood by without intervening. At 
another roadblock, trucks were pushed away and demonstrators negotiated 
with a police commander to be allowed through. At yet another blockade, 
angry protesters overturned a police car and dumped it into a ditch. 
The mass march on Belgrade followed a day of dramatic developments 
at the strikebound Kolubara coal mine. Police there were forced to 
abandon plans to take over the compound after confronting fearless 
anti-Milosevic crowds. Such defiance in the face of police was unprecedented 
in Yugoslavia's 55-year communist history.
