President Clinton is in Hanoi, the first US leader to visit Vietnam 
since it was unified in 1975 under communist rule at the end of the 
Vietnam War. VOA's David Gallust has details from the Vietnamese capital. 
It was nearly midnight by the time Mr. Clinton arrived here from Brunei 
and the APEC summit, but tens of thousands of Vietnamese turned out 
along the motorcade route to get a glimpse of Mr. Clinton, even though 
the Vietnamese government had given scant mention of the President's 
visit in the state media. There was a red carpet, but little ceremony 
at the airport. Mr. Clinton will be given an official welcome at mid-morning 
Friday and will hold talks immediately thereafter with Vietnamese 
President Chon Duglon. The visit climaxes a process of normalization 
and reconciliation between the former enemies that began in earnest 
after Mr. Clinton took office in 1993. Accounting for the nearly 2000 
US servicemen still missing from the war remains at the top of the 
US agenda, but the visit is otherwise intended to be forward looking 
with the President hopeful the trade agreement the two sides signed 
in July will help move communist Vietnam toward a freer society and 
economy. David Gullast, VOA News, Hanoi.
