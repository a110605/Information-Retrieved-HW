President Clinton arrived early Sunday in this city, the former Saigon, 
25 years after America's final evacuation in the face of victorious 
communist forces. Despite the late hour of his arrival, thousands 
of people lined the president's route for the 15-minute drive from 
the airport. After a day of poignant reminders of the losses America 
suffered in the war, Clinton flew here from Hanoi, where he attend 
a silent ceremony at Noi Bai airport for the formal repatriation of 
remains believed to be those of three U.S. servicemen. Earlier, Clinton 
also met with Vietnam's Communist Party chief, Le Kha Phieu, who, 
a senior American official said, spoke the language of ``old socialism'' 
in a meeting with Clinton and did not respond when he suggested that 
the country would benefit from more political freedom. ``It was the 
more traditional side of Vietnamese politics,'' the official said. 
``He did talk about openness. He did talk about private entrepreneurship, 
but more clearly in the context of what you would have heard here 
10 years ago or 15 years ago.'' A senior administration official said 
of the Vietnamese, ``They know they won the war, but they are wondering 
what went wrong with the peace.''
