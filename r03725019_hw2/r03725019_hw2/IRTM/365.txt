Army members said fighting broke out Wednesday morning at Abidjan's 
main military base between disgruntled soldiers and loyalists to Ivory 
Coast's junta leader, who has declared himself winner of presidential 
elections. Around 3 a.m., disgruntled soldiers attacked the munitions 
depot at the military base known as Akouedo, two army members confirmed 
to Associated Press. Gunshots were heard in the surrounding suburban 
neighborhood. ``It's serious,'' one soldier at the base said in a 
brief telephone interview. It was unclear whether there were casualties. 
No further details were available.
