In Yugoslavia, President Slobodan Milosevic's opponents plan to continue 
a general strike that began Monday, in an effort to force the certification 
of the opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica as the new President. 
Truck and taxi drivers blockaded roads and bridges and factories throughout 
the country. Late in the day, President Milosevic held his first news 
conference since the disputed election. VOA's Eve Cornette reports 
from Pristina. As thousands of protestors walked off their jobs, President 
Milosevic warned that if Mr. Kostinitca were to become President, 
Yugoslavia would, in his words "fall under foreign occupation and 
inevitably break-up." Mr. Milosevic said his policy guaranteed peace 
while that of the opposition's guaranteed clashes and hostility. He 
rejected Mr. Kostinitca's claim that the opposition won outright in 
a first round, saying a second round was needed. Coal miners, power 
plant workers and drivers, all joined in the protest to urge President 
Milosevic to step-down. Meanwhile, Mr. execution by a United Nation's 
court for alleged war crimes in Kosovo. He argued that by doing so, 
the United States was, in his words, "strengthening Mr. Milosevic 
in his belief that these elections are a question of life and death 
for him." Eve Cornette, VOA News, Pristina.
