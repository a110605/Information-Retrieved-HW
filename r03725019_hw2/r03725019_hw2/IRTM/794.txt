MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ U.S. Open champion Marat Safin, slowed 
by a sore elbow, was beaten in the first round of an Australian Open 
tuneup Wednesday. ``I'm afraid of making it worse. I don't want to 
be out six months,'' Safin said after his 6-2, 6-1 loss to France's 
Nicolas Escude in the Colonial Classic. In other matches, Spanish 
Davis Cup hero Juan Carlos Ferrero beat Pete Sampras 6-2, 6-4, and 
Olympic gold medalist Yevgeny Kafelnikov defeated two-time U.S. Open 
champion Patrick Rafter 6-2, 6-2. ``It just takes a couple of matches,'' 
said Sampras, who took a break from competition for most of last fall. 
``That's why this week is a perfect preparation.'' Safin planned to 
see a doctor later Wednesday, and decide then whether to continue 
in the eight-man exhibition tournament. ``If the doctor says I can 
play, I will play,'' he added. ``You have to be careful. Simple things 
can change your life.'' He said six months would be the recuperation 
period if surgery were needed. The Australian Open, the year's first 
Grand Slam tournament, starts next Monday. Safin, who climbed to No. 
2 in the rankings after a dismal start in 2000, was fined for not 
trying at last year's Australian. He has said he wants to show his 
true abilities this time. Safin said a similar elbow problem kept 
him out of action for more than a month 18 months ago. The problem 
started flaring up again last week, he said. Safin said the soreness 
apparently indicated he was doing something wrong in his strokes, 
and would have to fix it. He also said he did not have a coach with 
him here. The 20-year-old Russian made frequent groundstroke errors, 
and occasionally bounced his racket off the court in frustration. 
``It's difficult to play when you start to think about being sore,'' 
he said. In later first-round matches, Pete Sampras was to play Juan 
Carlos Ferrero, and Andre Agassi faced Nicolas Kiefer.
