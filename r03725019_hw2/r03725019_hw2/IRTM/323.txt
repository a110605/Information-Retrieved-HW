the investigation into the bombing of the "uss cole" is turning up 
new leads every day. but the identities of the culprits remain unknown. 
walter rodgers reports. a yemeni fishing boat passes the crippled 
destroyer "cole" with no coast guard and 2,000 miles of coastline, 
yemen appears to have been an ideal location to strike an american 
warship in port to refuel. historically boats get in and out of these 
waters easily. there is is a long tradition of smuggling here and 
privately u.s. officials do not believe the attack on the "cole" was 
hatched in yemen, but elsewhere in the islamic world. navy divers 
are still working the waters trying to recover clues. they are, according 
to sources, looking for the body parts of those who pilotted a small 
boat into the port side of the "cole" nearly sinking it. i will tell 
you we are a long way from any conclusions. a long way from preliminary 
conclusions. there are a lot of rumors going around, speculation going 
around. but there have been no conclusions yet. about six miles from 
the crippled "cole" u.s. investigators have pitched tents instant 
crime labs along the boat ramp from which the suicide attack was launched. 
at the house where the explosive device was believed to have been 
fbi avents have removed a great deal of evidence. yemeni police also 
believe they have found three other locations in this neighborhood 
also used by the bombers. so far, the investigation is still limited 
to this port city of aden. one u.s. official said the numbers of those 
detained or being questioned is now in three figures. it's still way 
too early to talk about american retaliation for the "cole", because 
it's still not known who to retaliate against. in the words of one 
senior official here "no one has ever seen an operation quite like 
this before." walter rodgers, cnn, aden, yemen.
