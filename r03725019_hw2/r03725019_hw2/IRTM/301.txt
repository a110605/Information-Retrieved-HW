British, Scandinavian and Russian divers have arrived at the spot 
where the Kursk nuclear submarine sank in August. They've began preparations 
for recovering the remains of the 118 crewmen who died in the incident. 
But Russian officials are warning it is a tricky and dangerous job 
and that safety concerns could force them to call it off.
