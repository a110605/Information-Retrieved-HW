five of the u.s. sailors killed in the attack on the destroyer "uss 
cole" are now home. a military transport plane brought the flag-draped 
caskets from germany where they were taken yesterday. an honor guard 
removed them to a hangar at dover air force base for a short memorial 
service for close family members. they requested privacy for today's 
proceedings. the bodies of two other sailors recovered from the ship 
are in bahrain and will be returned later.
