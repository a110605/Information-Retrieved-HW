in the barents sea, high winds have halted divers' recovery efforts 
on the sunken russian submarine "kursk." it's not clear when work 
will resume. deep-sea divers are trying to recover the remains of 
the 118 submariners who were killed when an explosion crippled the 
vessel. they hope to cut seven holes through both hulls to pull bodies 
out. but safety fears, stemming from metal debris and the submarine's 
two nuclear reactors, may force the russian navy to call off the work.
