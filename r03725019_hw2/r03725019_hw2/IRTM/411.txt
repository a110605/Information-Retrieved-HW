there was an example from the pentagon, ironically today, of how terrorists 
of get their wa, at least in part. the pentagon is planning to bring 
the "cole" back to the u.s. on this gigantic transport platform called 
the blue marlin. but as of now, not by the shortest route. the pentagon 
frs that going through the suez canal, which goes through egypt, may 
make the ships vulnerable. instead, they are planning a six-week long 
trip around africa. two weeks longer than going through the canal.
