A Pentagon Commission has concluded that US commanders in the Middle 
East must focus more on safety and recommends tighter security measures. 
A panel appointed by Secretary of Defense William Cohen after the 
suicide bombing on the US destroyer Cole, reportedly found security 
lapses for ships and aircraft moving throughout the region. Cole, 
attacked in the Yemeni port of Aden last October, resulted in the 
death of seventeen sailors and the wounding of thirty-nine others.
