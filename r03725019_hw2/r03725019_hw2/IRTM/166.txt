For relatives of sailors aboard the USS Cole, the wait was agonizing. 
Denise Overturff of Norfolk knows she's one of the lucky ones. Her 
husband, Robert, survived Thursday's explosion in a Yemeni harbor 
that killed at least six crew members and injured 35. Eleven others 
were missing. Still, her joy over her husband's survival was tempered 
by other emotions, Overturff said. ``I've been thinking about the 
other families, and my heart just goes out for their tragedies,'' 
she told The Associated Press Thursday night. The 505-foot long, 8,600-ton 
destroyer is based at the huge naval base in this Virginia port city. 
Overturff's husband has been aboard the ship for about a year. ``They 
just told me he was A-OK,'' she said with a sigh of relief. ``They're 
telling us they don't know anything else until they assess the damage 
and figure out what's what.'' She tried throughout the day Thursday 
to get through on a hot line promising information to family members. 
But hundreds of other relatives jammed the lines. Overturff eventually 
got an answer. ``Making that call was the hardest thing I've ever 
had to do,'' she said. ``I'm just exhausted.'' Senior Chief Petty 
Officer John Henderson was in the control room of the ship when the 
explosion hit, said his wife, Carin Henderson of Chesapeake. All she 
knows is that he was ``injured, and that he's in the hospital.'' Henderson 
left work when she learned of the explosion and watched TV all day. 
Then she got a call from one of her husband's former commanding officers. 
``Of course, my heart stopped,'' she said. John Henderson, an 18-year 
Navy veteran, plans to retire after this tour of duty, his wife said. 
Virginia Brown of Norfolk was among 150 relatives who came to the 
Norfolk Naval Station seeking information. ``Frantic, panic'' was 
how Brown described her mood. ``You pray a lot, cry a lot. Your mind 
just wanders. You try to picture the ship and picture where your husband 
can be.'' Leslie Roper, a regional civilian ombudsman for Navy families, 
said relatives tend to ``come together to try to support each other'' 
in times of crisis. City officials also rallied to help the families. 
Norfolk Mayor Paul D. Fraim urged the community to show support for 
the Navy. Among his recommendations was that people attending a concert 
by country singer Lee Greenwood Friday night bring candles for a moment 
of silence. Navy officials said all next of kin of Cole crew members 
would be notified about their loved one's status, and relatives of 
crew members who were killed would be notified in person. ``I'm just 
glad I got word over the phone, and not a visit,'' Overturff said.
