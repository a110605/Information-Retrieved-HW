tom, u.s. officials tonight are assessing new threats made against 
american warships in the middle east. this latest threat calls for 
more terrorist bombings like that against the "uss cole," but steskically 
on the "cole," but specifically targets american and israeli ships 
in the suez canal. it comes from egyptian militant rifai ahmed taha, 
seen here with terrorist osama bin laden in a video tape that threatens 
attacks on americans in yemen released only three weeks before the 
"cole" is hit. why yemen? meanwhile, on capitol hill, lawmakers want 
to know why u.s. warships refuel in yemen at all, since it's known 
as a hotbed of terrorism. retired marine corps general anthony zinni 
said he made the decision to improve military ties with yemen and 
because -- the threat conditions in aden the specific threat conditions 
were actually better than anywhere else. but a state department report 
says in the last two years, there have been 35 significant terrorist 
incidents in yemen. and yemen is one of only four countries in the 
world where terrorist attacks against americans have increased -- 
52%. it's sort of like the wild, wild west. there is no central authority. 
at the same time, the pentagon launches its own investigation to determine 
what, if anything, went wrong with security for the "cole." we will 
never have a perfect defense against terrorism. but we need to make 
our defenses as good as they can be. but too late for the "cole." 
tonight, the navy has finished recovering all remains of the 17 sailors 
killed in the sneak attack. officials here new about the bin laden 
warning before the "cole" was attacked. the threat was considered 
so nonspecific, u.s. warships were not put on a higher state of alert. 
tom? thanks very much, nbc's jim miklaszewski tonight.
