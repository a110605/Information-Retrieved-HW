US Defense Department's Commission is investigating the bombing of 
the USS Cole, says American commanders in the Middle East are doing 
not enough to protect their forces. Defense officials familiar with 
the Commission's findings say there were significant security lapses 
in the region despite measures put in place after the bombing of a 
US Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia more than four years ago.
