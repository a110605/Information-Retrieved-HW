An apparent suicide terrorist bombing tore into a U.S. Navy destroyer 
Thursday, killing four Americans, injuring three dozen and leaving 
12 missing, the Defense Department said. Authorities said the explosion 
was triggered by a small boat that had pulled alongside the ship as 
it was docked in the Arabian Peninsula. President Clinton said the 
attack on the USS Cole appeared to be an act of terrorism. ``We will 
find out who was responsible and hold them accountable,'' he pledged. 
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, U.S. officials said. 
Calling the attack a ``despicable and cowardly act,'' Clinton told 
reporters at the White House that he had ordered all Navy ships in 
the region to pull out of port as a safety precaution and a heightened 
state of alert at U.S. military bases. He had a message for those 
responsible for the attack: ``If their intention was to deter us from 
our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East, they 
will fail utterly.'' The president said he had dispatched investigators 
from the State Department, the Pentagon and the FBI to Yemen. He said 
Yemen had pledged its cooperation.
