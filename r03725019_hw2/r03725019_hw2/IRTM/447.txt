and in the middle east tonight, more worries about terrorism. the 
pentagon issues a new warning for u.s. servicemen in saudi arabia 
and kuwait. joining us now is nbc's pentagon correspondent, jim miklaszewski. 
jim, what prompted this latest alert? u.s. intelligence picked up 
more credible and imminent terrorist threats. so now all american 
troops in the persian gulf are at the highest state of alert -- threat 
con delta. as the "uss cole" prepares to come home -- 20 miles out 
to sea, the crippled "cole" is loaded onto the heavy lift ship, "blue 
marlin." in this navy satellite video, the marlin actually submerges. 
tugs push the cole into position over the deck, and the marlin rises 
to lift the 8,000 ton warship out of the water. the cole will take 
the long way home, around the southern tip of africa on its way to 
norfolk, avoiding the shorter route through the suez canal because 
of ongoing terrorist threats. the trip will take 35 days. meanwhile, 
major parts of the "cole" investigation are at a standstill tonight. 
yemen authorities are still not cooperating with the fbi, at least 
fully. and u.s. officials report that the suspects, they have no firm 
evidence to link any possible suspects to the attack on the "cole." 
tom? thank you very much, nbc's jim miklaszewski tonight.
