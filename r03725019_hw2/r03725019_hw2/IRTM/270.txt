President Clinton has told a memorial service for the victims of the 
deadly bomb attack on the USS Cole that justice will prevail. Mr. 
Clinton promised the gathering at the Norfolk Naval station Wednesday 
that those who carried out the deadly attack that killed 17 sailors 
will be found. To those who attacked them, we say you will not find 
a safe harbor. We will find you and justice will prevail. Meanwhile, 
in Yemen President Ali Abdul Salay said important evidence had been 
uncovered in the investigation. President Salay was quoted as saying 
two people responsible for the blast were killed in a suicide mission 
and that the attack had been planned for a long time. His comments 
were not immediately confirmed by US officials who are leading the 
investigation with Yemen's help.
