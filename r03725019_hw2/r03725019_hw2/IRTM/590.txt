President Clinton says the trend toward freedom in Vietnam is strong. 
He is now on his way home after a three-day landmark visit there. 
While describing the trend as almost impossible to reverse, Mr. Clinton 
said Vietnam will only fulfill its potential and attract foreign investment 
if it further opens its society. He made the comments in a TV interview 
with CNN where he also talked about Vietnam's cooperation in finding 
missing American soldiers from the Vietnam war. Mr. Clinton says he 
visited one crash site with the sons of an American pilot believed 
to have crashed there. I was very grateful for the cooperation we 
received from the Vietnamese government and the individual villagers, 
you know, there were these people out there stomping around in the 
mud, trying to find some trace of those boys' father. In an earlier 
speech Mr. Clinton said the future of Vietnam and its young people 
lies in a new era of capitalism, innovation and competition.
