The Yugoslav constitutional court has annulled parts of last month's 
contested presidential election. According to the state run news agency 
Tonugue, the court invalidated opposition claims that President Slobodan 
Milosevic lost the election. The impact of the court's ruling was 
not immediately clear and Tonugue said the court's full statement 
would be released later today. However, the members of the court are 
known to be Milosevic's supporters and the appeal was brought by the 
opposition, which asked that challenger Vojislav Kostunica be declared 
the winner of the September 24th election. Mr. Kostunica's supporters 
have been staging mass protest demonstration across the country since 
Monday.
