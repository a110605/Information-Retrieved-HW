After recovering 12 bodies from the rear of the sunken nuclear submarine 
Kursk, divers switched their focus Tuesday to a forward section near 
the main escape hatch, where many of the crew may have perished. At 
least one explosion of unknown origin sent the Kursk to the bottom 
of the Barents Sea, last August 12th. All 118 crew members were killed.
