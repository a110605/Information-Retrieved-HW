Soldiers pulled out three people trapped under rubble for 36 hours, 
the first found alive under collapsed buildings from India's devastating 
earthquake. Another powerful tremor Sunday shook the area, where 13,000 
are feared dead from the disaster. An army engineers corp, among the 
5,000 Indian soldiers deployed in the state of Gujarat, rescued two 
men and a girl on Saturday afternoon after digging through the fallen 
masonry of their homes in Bhuj, the town closest to the epicenter 
of Friday's 7.9-magnitude quake, said Capt. Amartej Singh. The condition 
of the three people was not immediately known. It was not known if 
they were related. Singh said his unit also recovered 10 bodies. But 
bolstered by their success in saving three lives, the soldiers started 
digging on Sunday through another mountain of rubble where a resident 
said he could hear his brother's voice. Rambhai Mulshankar, a 40-year-old 
goldsmith, led the soldiers to his fallen house. ``I can even now 
hear my brother's cries for help,'' Mulshankar said.
