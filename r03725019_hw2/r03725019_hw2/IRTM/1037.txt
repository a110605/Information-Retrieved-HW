Soldiers pulled out three people trapped under rubble for 36 hours, 
the first found alive under collapsed buildings from India's devastating 
earthquake. Another powerful tremor Sunday shook the area, where 13,000 
are feared dead from the disaster. An army engineers corp, among the 
5,000 Indian soldiers deployed in the state of Gujarat, rescued two 
men and a girl on Saturday afternoon after digging through the fallen 
masonry of their homes in Bhuj, the town closest to the epicenter 
of Friday's 7.9-magnitude quake, said Capt. Amartej Singh. The condition 
of the three people was not immediately known. It was not known if 
they were related. Singh said his unit also recovered 10 bodies. But 
bolstered by their success in saving three lives, the soldiers started 
digging on Sunday through another mountain of rubble where a resident 
said he could hear his brother's voice. Rambhai Mulshankar, a 40-year-old 
goldsmith, led the soldiers to his fallen house. ``I can even now 
hear my brother's cries for help,'' Mulshankar said. BHUJ, India: 
Mulshankar said. About 2,500 bodies have been recovered so far. One 
official has said the death toll will reach 13,000 from the 7.9 magnitude 
temblor that hit Gujarat Friday. The rescue of the three people was 
the first report of anyone being pulled out alive from the rubble. 
On Sunday, an aftershock of about 5.9 magnitude hit the area, said 
V.K. Shukla, a seismologist at the government meteorology center in 
India's capital, New Delhi. The exact magnitude has not been calculated, 
but it is in the range of 5.9 and 6, with an epicenter about 12 miles 
from the epicenter of Friday's quake, he said. People rushed out of 
their homes as they were woken up by the tremor around 6.45 a.m. in 
Ahmedabad, the commercial capital of Gujarat state, where more than 
400 people died in Friday's quake. Homeless people sleeping in the 
open in biting cold also were woken up.
