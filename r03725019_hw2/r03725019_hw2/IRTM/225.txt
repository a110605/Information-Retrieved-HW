Thirty-three US sailors injured in a deadly blast that left the USS 
Cole crippled in Yemen seaport Aden have come home. The sailors returned 
to the United States after receiving medical treatment in Germany. 
A military transport plane brought the injured sailors to their home 
base of Norfolk Virginia on Sunday where they received an emotional 
greeting from family members who were brought to the navy facility 
from all over the United States. Six more seriously injured shipmates 
stayed behind at Ramstein air force base in Germany for further treatment. 
Meanwhile, in Yemen scores of US forensic investigators have descended 
on Aden to begin probing Thursday's blast which killed 17 sailors 
aboard the guided missile destroyer as it docked to refuel. In a press 
briefing, the American Ambassador to Yemen Barbara Bodien commented 
on the explosion. All the evidence does point very clearly that the 
explosion came outside the ship. Now exactly who was behind it, what 
their motivation was and how they were able to arrange it that we 
can't speculate on, but certainly the explosion did come from outside 
the ship.
