abc % h@ ab today in serbia -- blockades, demonstrations, civil disobedience, 
which opposition supporters hope will culminate in a nationwide strike 
on monday. people of serbia have shown their own will. now we are 
defending our victory. we will succeed. success in pushing slobodan 
milosevic out of office will likely depend on the loyalties of the 
yugoslav army, loyalties that may shift to the opposition if it appears 
especially powerful tomorrow. if the demonstrations come off as scheduled 
on monday, and it is a very, very large crowd and there's a very strong 
sense of determination, then i think the army will swing over with 
the crowd. i think if the demonstrations are weak, then it could go 
the other way. milosevic did appear to get a blow this weekend from 
an old ally. the white house said today that russian president vladimir 
putin is supporting the u.s. position that it was opposition leader 
vojislav kostunica who was the victor in elections held last week. 
putin has not commented about this publicly, but he did send two russian 
negotiators to belgrade today. secretary of state madeleine albright 
added her strong words today in an essay for "newsweek" magazine. 
the secretary wrote -- despite growing pressure to relinquish power 
peacefully, milosevic has shown no signs that he is ready to do that, 
insisting that the runoff election scheduled for next sunday will 
go ahead no matter what. martha raddatz, abc news, the state department.
