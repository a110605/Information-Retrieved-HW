US officials say the crippled US Navy destroyer Cole is ready to be 
moved out of Aden back to its homeport of Norfolk, Virginian. A huge 
Norwegian transport vessel is to carry the Cole across the Atlantic 
Ocean. Following the suspected terrorist attack that killed 17 of 
the Cole's sailors, US officials say they are still piecing together 
evidence they hope will lead to the capture of those responsible.
