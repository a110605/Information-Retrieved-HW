the attack on the "uss cole" in yemen is being reassessed tonight. 
abc's barry serafin is in our washington bureau. i gather the thing 
that the navy is looking at is the actual timing. we were led to believe 
that the attack occurred just as the "uss cole" was tying up. not 
true, apparently? not true, according to new information now released 
by the navy, peter. the navy now says the ship was actually moored 
nearly two hours before the explosion took place. it was, in fact, 
in the process of being refueled at the time of the blast. the original 
scenario was the theory was that rtj c world news/peter jennings abc 
% rtj ! had slipped in as part of the moorin operation. that was not 
true. the ship was tied up, it was in a very vulnerable position as 
it was being refueled. however, the navy now says that hands-on deck 
who were manning machine guns, as part of an alert, still believed 
they had seen this small boat as part of the mooring operation, and 
that is apparently why they were not suspicious. let me understand 
the last point again. if it was not part of the mooring operation, 
does it mean it was lost in a cluster of boats or operating clear 
to sea? this was a small boat that at that point, peter, should not 
have been approaching this ship, but apparently the hands on deck 
who were supposed to be maintaining security, believed this was a 
small boat they had seen earlier as part of the mooring operation, 
and therefore did not view it as a suspicious boat. thanks very much. 
it often happens in a case like this, as time goes on, the assessment 
changes. today, the bodies of the last four sailors recovered from 
the "cole" were sent home to the united states. 17 sailors were killed 
in the blast. at arlington national cemetery, the first of the funerals. 
cheron gunn from rex, georgia was buried next to his ship mate richard 
costello of morrisville, pennsylvania.
