Rescue workers in India's Gujarat State continue finding some people 
alive more than 60 hours after Friday's devastating earthquake, which 
is estimated to have killed more than 20,000 people. Reuters reports 
that among those rescued Sunday were a seven-year-old boy and his 
mother who were pulled from the debris in the city of Bhuj. Reports 
say the 500-year old walled city was almost completely destroyed. 
The death toll from the earthquake, India's worst in a half century, 
is certain to rise. Authorities say as many as 125,000 people are 
missing in and around Bhuj and elsewhere in the region. India is seeking 
a 1.5 billion dollar disaster loan from the World Bank and the Asia 
Development Bank.
