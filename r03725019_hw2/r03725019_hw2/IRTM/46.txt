Thank you very much Vick. Yugoslavia's Constitutional Court is expected 
to release details today about its decision to annul part of the results 
of the recent presidential elections. The official Tanugue news agency 
says the Court acted Wednesday following an emergency session to hear 
opposition complaints about vote rigging and the decision came just 
hours after the opposition said President Slobodan Milosevic had until 
3 p.m. local time today to resign and announce the true election results. 
The opposition claims its candidate won more than half the vote.
