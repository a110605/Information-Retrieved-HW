Slobodan Milosevic's police entered a major coal mine south of here 
Wednesday to break up one of the biggest strikes launched so far to 
drive the Yugoslav president from power, an independent news agency 
said. Truckloads of police and soldiers entered the Kolubara mine 
complex after the government said the five-day strike threatened electricity 
supplies, the independent Beta news agency said. A striker who answered 
the telephone at the facility said miners were refusing to leave the 
compound and so far there had been no clashes nor arrests. He refused 
to give his name. Beta quoted a strike leader Predgrag Stefanovic 
as appealing to residents of nearby towns ``to come and help us.'' 
The action came one day after the Milosevic government threatened 
``special measures'' against leaders of strikes and road blockades, 
which were launched this week to force the Yugoslav president to concede 
defeat to challenger Vojislav Kostunica in the Sept. 24 election. 
Milosevic concedes that Kostunica outpolled him in the five-candidate 
race but fell short of an absolute majority. A run-off is set for 
Sunday but the opposition has called for a boycott. Earlier, police 
arrested several truck drivers blocking roads in Milosevic's hometown 
Pozarevac about 30 miles southeast of Belgrade. Beta said the government 
had brought in strikebreakers from Kosovo, where many miners are out 
of work since NATO and the United Nations took over the province last 
year. The opposition has accused Milosevic of massive fraud in the 
election and on Wednesday sought to prove the allegations before Yugoslavia's 
Constitutional Court. The tribunal met in emergency session to hear 
claims by the 18-party opposition coalition that Milosevic's cronies 
manipulated election results by using a sophisticated software program. 
Opposition leaders said they had obtained a copy of the program and 
would use it to illustrate how the vote was rigged to favor Milosevic's 
candidacy. But the court is full of Milosevic loyalists and has rendered 
a number of controversial verdicts. Information Minister Goran Matic 
claimed the opposition ``committed electoral fraud'' and was now trying 
to provoke violence by ``discrediting and denying the validity of 
the result.'' With dozens of road blocks in place for the third day 
as part of the opposition's campaign of anti-Milosevic civil disobedience, 
police attempted to clear roads in some areas but refrained from using 
force, Beta reported. But near Pozarevac, Milosevic's home town, about 
30 miles southeast of Belgrade, tensions grew after police arrested 
several truckers whose vehicles were blocking a road. Dozens of people 
subsequently sat down on the pavement, strengthening the blockade. 
The opposition planned a rally in Belgrade for Thursday billed as 
a final push to drive Milosevic from power. There were signs that 
Milosevic's control over the media, until now the principal propaganda 
pillar of his regime, was fraying. The main state-run daily in the 
northern province of Vojvodina declared Wednesday that its editorial 
policy would switch from following the government line to objectively 
reporting on events. Its Wednesday edition carried numerous reports 
on opposition activities. Previously, it had reported on the opposition 
only to criticize them as lackeys of the West. In Belgrade, where 
the civil disobedience campaign has been less noticeable than in other 
cities, more people appeared to be joining the opposition protests. 
Hundreds of stores were closed and city bus drivers and garbage collectors 
stayed off the job, leaving overflowing trash containers scattered 
in the streets. The postal service announced a warning strike for 
later in the day, and by noon, the city core was effectively put off 
limits to cars and other vehicles by thousands of pedestrians roaming 
the streets and blocking traffic. On Tuesday, Belgrade's prosecutor 
issued arrest orders for 13 opposition leaders involved in organizing 
a walkout at the Kolubara coal mine. In an interview published in 
Moscow's Komersant daily, Kostunica said he believed Milosevic was 
preparing to resort to force. ``He experiences no moral dilemma or 
torments of the soul about that,'' Kostunica said in comments published 
Wednesday. ``However ... it is clear that he does not have enough 
force at present.'' Milosevic acknowledges Kostunica won more votes 
in the five-candidate contest but insists he fell short of the required 
majority and has called a run-off for Sunday. The opposition claim 
Kostunica won the election outright and refuse to participate in the 
run-off, claiming the Yugoslav president would only cheat again.
