Ivory Coast's Supreme Court has rejected the candidacy of Opposition 
leader Alassane Ouattara, Head of this month's presidential elections. 
VOA's Luis Ramirez reports the announcement was made as the West African 
country came under a curfew and a state of emergency. The much-awaited 
announcement was delivered on state television after Ivory Coast's 
military government reminded viewers that the curfew would be strictly 
enforced. The Ivorian Supreme Court said it rejected Mr. Ouattara's 
candidacy based on what it said was his inability to prove that he 
is a full Ivorian national as mandated by a newly approved constitution. 
The elections on October 22nd are to return Ivory Coast to civilian 
rule, following the country's first coup last December. The coup put 
General Robert Guei in power. Mr. Gay is among five out of 19 candidates 
who are being allowed to run. The curfew was put in force after supporters 
of Mr. Ouattara vowed to retaliate if his candidacy was rejected.

for calm. He said he was shocked by the court decision, but pleaded 
with his supporters to resist violence.
