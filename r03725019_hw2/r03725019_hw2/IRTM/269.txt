A memorial service was held, Wednesday at the Norfolk, Virginia naval 
station for the 17 sailors who died in the apparent suicide attack 
on the US Navy destroyer 'Cole'. President Clinton spoke of his grief 
at the loss of the sailors. Today we honor our finest young people, 
fallen soldiers who rose to freedom's challenge. We moan their loss, 
celebrate their lives, offer the love and prayers of a grateful nation 
to their families. Mr. Clinton also promised that those who carried 
out the attack on the USS Cole will be found. The Republican presidential 
challenger, George W. Bush also pledged if elected, to find and punish 
the Cole's attackers. The best way to stop terrorism is to send a 
chilling message. Somebody would say what's that's message going to 
be? And I'd say, well, should I be the President, those who committed 
the act of terrorism, we are going to find out and they are not gonna 
like it.
