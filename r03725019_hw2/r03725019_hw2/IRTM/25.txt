The Serbian government issued a harsh warning to the democratic opposition 
on Tuesday, promising ``special measures'' and prosecutions against 
those organizing a spreading general strike intended to oust Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. The statement, read on state television, 
heralded a counterattack on political leaders who are organizing the 
strikes to support Milosevic's challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, and 
on the independent news media reporting on the effort. Early Tuesday, 
the police arrested the head of the public-transport trade union, 
Dragoljub Stosic, and ordered protesters to clear away their obstacles 
blocking the bus garage. The government also said it would seek the 
arrest of 11 organizers of a coal miners' strike at Kolubara. State 
television said that two opposition politicians who have helped the 
strikers, Nebojsa Covic and Boris Tadic, would also face charges. 
The opposition is trying to force Milosevic to concede an outright, 
first-round electoral victory to Kostunica, who says that only massive 
government vote fraud denied him the presidency in elections on Sept. 
24. Milosevic is organizing a second-round runoff for Sunday that 
Kostunica vows to boycott, saying a runoff is unnecessary. In its 
statement on Tuesday, the government said, ``The violent behavior 
of individuals and groups that threatens citizens' lives, disrupts 
normal functioning of traffic, prevents normal work of industry, schools, 
institutions and health facilities will be proscribed by law. ``Special 
measures will be taken against the organizers of these criminal activities,'' 
the government said. The strike continued to spread on Tuesday. About 
50,000 students were turned back peacefully after marching toward 
Milosevic's home outside Belgrade. At least 30,000 people rallied 
in Novi Sad, and 10,000 gathered in Nis, two towns that are opposition 
strongholds. And 50,000 people in Kragujevac came to hear Kostunica 
speak.
