Defense Secretary William Cohen is closing out the USS Cole bombing 
investigation by declaring that no one in the military chain of command 
should be accused of negligence but all could be faulted for inadequate 
attention to terrorist threats, officials said Friday. The Navy was 
releasing its final investigation report on the case Friday. As previously 
reported, Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations, has concluded 
that no one aboard the Cole should be disciplined. Officials, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, said they expected Cohen to issue a statement 
Friday on accountability. Cohen believes the entire military chain 
of command can be faulted for not paying more attention to the vulnerability 
of U.S. ships in areas where the terrorist threat is high. At the 
same time Cohen has concluded that no individuals should be punished. 
The Cole was bombed by suicide terrorists in a small boat while the 
destroyer was refueling in Aden, Yemen, on Oct. 12. The attack killed 
17 sailors and nearly sunk the $1 billion ship. ``All of us in the 
whole chain of command have to do a better job and we had that obligation 
to all of the soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, coast guardsmen 
and their families, and a better job has to be done,'' Cohen said 
Friday on NBC's ``Today'' show. Cohen said he agrees with the findings 
of an independent panel he established to assess ways in which the 
Defense Department, in coordination with other government agencies, 
can provide better protection for U.S. forces in transit around the 
world. The panel cited, among other things, a need for better intelligence 
collection on terrorist threats. In his NBC interview, Cohen said 
the Cole bombing exposed a seam in U.S. security precautions. ``There 
has not been sufficient attention devoted to those ships that are 
in transit, about to come into a port or while they're in port,'' 
he said. ``You have a number of seams'' in security. ``It's our job 
to make sure that we appreciate the seams faster than the terrorists 
do. There will always be terrorists looking for weaknesses.'' Cohen 
wanted to close the Cole case before he left office. Friday was his 
final full day as defense secretary. The job of implementing the recommended 
improvements in security will fall to Cohen's successor, Defense Secretary-designate 
Donald Rumsfeld. Because the Cole's captain, Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, did 
not carry out all of approximately 60 planned actions to ensure the 
ship's protection while refueling in Aden harbor, some believed he 
would be punished and his career ruined. Instead, Clark supported 
a determination that Lippold had done what could have been reasonably 
expected under the circumstances and that he was not given necessary 
information about the terrorist threat in Aden, a major port at the 
southern tip of the Saudi peninsula. Clark also believes that even 
with security measures in place as prescribed, the attack would not 
have been prevented, officials said. The nature of the attack was 
unprecedented, although the threat was not unimaginable. The military's 
written guidelines on terror threats states explicitly that harbor 
craft of the sort that approached the Cole ``require special concern 
because they can serve as an ideal platform for terrorists.'' The 
guidelines say fire hoses should be ready for emergency use and personnel 
be briefed on using them for repelling boarders, small boats and ultralight 
aircraft. Lippold made a decision on his own not to prepare for the 
use of fire hoses, another senior defense official said, also speaking 
anonymously. Lippold apparently believed that fire hoses would not 
have strengthened the ship's defenses. Some crew members said after 
the bombing that they saw the small boat approach the Cole and assumed 
it was yet another harbor craft providing trash disposal and other 
services. No one on the Cole challenged the craft as it approached.
