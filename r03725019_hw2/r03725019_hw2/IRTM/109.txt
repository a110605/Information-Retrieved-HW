Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Sunday criticized Russia 
for moving slowly to recognize Vojislav Kostunica as president. Albright 
also hedged on whether the administration would continue to insist 
that Slobodan Milosevic be tried in The Hague as a war criminal. Kostunica, 
a legal scholar who questions the independence of the U.N. war crimes 
tribunal, has made it clear he will not arrest Milosevic or extradite 
him, saying that Milosevic's electoral concession should not be ``a 
matter of life or death.'' Albright said on NBC's ``Meet the Press' 
that there must be ``accountability'' and respect for ``the rule of 
law.'' She also stressed her support for the war crimes tribunal. 
But she declined to respond directly on whether she thought Milosevic 
should be extradited to The Hague. Milosevic and some top aides also 
have been charged with war crimes in conflicts in Croatia and Kosovo. 
They have not been arrested or brought to trial. Robin Cook, the British 
foreign secretary, said in London that decisions about Milosevic's 
future could wait until the government consolidated its power. But 
he said Kostunica's victory presented ``a better chance'' of bringing 
Milosevic to trial in The Hague. ``We can't continue to try the generals, 
the sergeants ... and not hold to account the man whose policies they 
were carrying out,'' Cook told Sky TV on Sunday. In Washington, a 
senior U.S. official said the first priority was that Kostunica's 
government settle in and take effective control of the reins of power. 
But as Yugoslavia draws closer to European nations, the new government 
will realize that until Milosevic faces the war crimes tribunal, Yugoslavia 
will not be reintegrated, said the official, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. Russia lagged behind the United States and the European 
allies in recognizing Kostunica's triumph in the Sept. 24 election. 
And Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who went to Belgrade to arrange 
a resignation deal in meeting with Kostunica and Milosevic, was said 
by Western sources to have carried assurances that if Milosevic surrendered 
power there would be no pressure for a war crimes trial. ``We did 
not want the Russians to mediate,'' Albright said, reflecting the 
U.S. position that no deal should be cut with Milosevic. ``They weren't 
the only ones there,'' she said, adding, ``They did not play the role 
they needed to at the right time.'' But ``in recognizing President 
Kostunica, they have done the right thing,'' Albright said. Meanwhile, 
Sandy Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, said 
Milosevic was an indicted war criminal and ``deservedly so.'' ``And 
we believe he has to be accountable,'' Berger said on ABC's ``This 
Week.'' Berger was also critical of Russia's role in the turnover 
of power in Belgrade. He said the Russians threw their weight behind 
Kostunica ``at the 11th hour'' but ``wish it had been at the 10th 
hour.'' Russia's role was an issue in last week's presidential debate 
between Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Republican 
Bush suggested the Russians ``have a lot of sway'' in Yugoslavia and 
might be able to persuade Milosevic to leave office. Democrat Gore 
said he was troubled by Russia's unwillingness to recognize Kostunica's 
election victory and if President Vladimir Putin mediated, ``We might 
not like the result.''
