federal investigators are trying to determine who is responsible for 
the attack on the "uss cole." carl rochelle has more. fbi investigators 
and other u.s. investigators are on the scene in yemen trying to determine 
who was responsible for the explosion that damaged the "uss cole," 
the guided missile destroyer. one of the things they are looking at 
is a fax that came from an organization to news organizations in beirut, 
the group calling itself, the "group of martyrs of the intifada of 
the al axam mosque" affiliated with the islamic deterrent forces. 
that group is claiming responsibility, but officials say they are 
not ruling out any other groups at this point, including the osama 
bin laden terrorist organization, that has pointed itself toward u.s. 
interests around the world. defense secretary william cohen says finding 
out who was responsible is a top priority. we are at least working 
on the assumption that this was a boat loaded with some high explosives, 
that approached the ship and caused extensive damage. again, we don't 
want to reach a final judgment yet, but it appears to be an act of 
terrorism. and that's what we're going to pursue with all of our intelligence 
community to see exactly what took place, identify individuals if 
it was a group or individual terrorists. we are going to identify 
them, and track them down and hold them fully accountable. while investigators 
try to determine who was responsible for the terrorist bomb against 
the "uss cole," navy divers continue to look at the ship. navy repair 
crews to try to determine what needs to be done to get it ready to 
go back to the united states. the divers discovered when they went 
in the water that the hole was larger than earlier believed, 40 feet 
by 40 feet. officials say it likely would have been 400 to 500 pounds 
of explosives that caused such an extensive damage to the ship. i'm
