It's been 16 years since he managed to break out, but convicted rapist 
Roy Wayne Bevan, the longest-sought fugitive from a Texas prison, 
still remembers the euphoria _ and the panic. ``It's like running 
in the blind,'' Bevan recalled in an interview last week with The 
Associated Press. ``You don't know really what's out there. You're 
just running and hoping for the best.'' Bevan's capture in 1995 after 
10 years reinforced Texas' reputation as a state that keeps its 150,000-plus 
inmates locked up and hunts down those who flee. Until Dec. 13, when 
seven prisoners stormed out of the Connally Unit in south Texas, 2000 
was shaping up as a single-digit year for escapes, with just nine. 
Those seven joined only one other fugitive currently on the Texas 
books, an inmate under surveillance in Mexico. The seven, believed 
responsible for the Christmas Eve killing of a policeman in the Dallas 
area, have a $200,000 bounty on their heads and are the subjects of 
a nationwide search. Bevan was careful to distinguish himself from 
the recent escapees. ``I don't like the violence,'' he said. ``That 
wasn't my thing. I was trying to get away and trying to start over.'' 
Bevan slipped out of the Coffield Unit, near Palestine in east Texas, 
on Feb. 15, 1985. In his decade on the loose, the former oilfield 
worker learned the importance of remaining disciplined. He never called 
relatives, for example, figuring authorities would be monitoring the 
telephone lines. ``My mother was living at the time. She died when 
I was on the run. I didn't even know about that until I was locked 
back up,'' he said. Once outside the prison, Bevan, now 44, carefully 
sought work. He'd go to a service station and offer to work for half-price 
for a day for cash. He went to a big city _ a learning experience 
for a country guy. He bought a phony ID card on the street. He grew 
a beard. He let his hair grow. ``Every day you gain confidence,'' 
he said. But even after maintaining the charade for years, knowing 
that someone was always hunting for him was ``like a little ghost 
on your shoulder,'' he said. Meanwhile, prison system investigators 
were connecting with an established intelligence network _ state fugitive 
task forces _ and local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. 
That's what finally tripped up Bevan, who was calling himself ``Jesse 
D. Waight.'' After ``Waight'' was convicted in Minnesota of sexually 
assaulting a child, an FBI investigator matched his fingerprints to 
those of the man missing from the Texas prison. On Sept. 29, 1995, 
at a home in Osseo, Minn., Bevan was captured. He wasn't entirely 
surprised. ``I knew I would be eventually,'' he said. ``One morning 
I went out and everybody had surrounded the house. I knew the time 
was up.'' ___ On the Net: Texas Department of Criminal Justice: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/
