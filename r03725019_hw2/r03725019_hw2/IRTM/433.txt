Ivory Coast's main opposition leader Alisan Ouattara is calling for 
an international inquiry into the massacre of dozens of people found 
in a mass grave. Nancy Paulis reports from Abidjan. Mr. Ouattara's 
rally of the Republican's party or RDR describes the killings as a 
form of ethnic cleansing. The bodies of more than 50 young men, identified 
as RDR supporters from the Abovo suburb of Abidjan, were discovered 
Thursday in a wooded area outside the city. More than 100 people have 
died in ethnic clashes since Thursday. The latest fighting was touched 
off when supporters of Mr. Ouattara took to the streets, demanding 
new elections after the fall of military leader Robert Guei, earlier 
in the week. Mr. Ouattara had been barred from last Sunday's elections, 
which were widely regarded has flawed. During the clashes, Thursday, 
police attacked RDR supporters, in predominantly Jewish sections of 
Abovo. Witnesses say they saw police round up scores, abused, stripped 
them, then dragged them to the area police camp where they executed 
them. Nancy Paulis for VOA News, Abidjan.
