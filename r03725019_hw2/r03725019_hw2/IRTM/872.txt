From BBC News in London, I am Gregor Cragey for The World. El Salvador's 
President Francisco Flores is warning more disasters are possible 
after Saturday's earthquake. Flores says there could be more landslides 
because the quake left many hill sides unstable. Meanwhile, there 
is little hope of finding any more survivors. The BBC's Malcolm Bravent 
reports. It has been three days since the last survivor was dug out 
of the mud and hope is fading that any more will be found. Officially 
the government's main priority is saving life, but disaster experts 
suspect it won't be long before the search for survivors is called 
off. Some analysts believe that the impact of this earthquake on Central 
America could outweigh that of Hurricane Mitch, which devastated the 
region two years ago. Twenty thousand people have been made homeless 
and several towns have been completely leveled. Malcolm Brevant.
