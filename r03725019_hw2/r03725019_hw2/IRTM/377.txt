A Russian diver has found the bodies of three of the 118 sailors who 
were killed when the nuclear submarine Kursk sank in the Barents Sea. 
The diver entered the sub after a Russian and Norwegian recovery team 
cut a hole wide enough for him to enter a rear compartment. The drilling 
and cutting effort took several days. Navy officials do not expect 
that all 118 bodies can be recovered.
