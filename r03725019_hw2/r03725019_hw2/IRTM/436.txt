Ivory Coast's main opposition leader Alasan Ouattara is calling for 
an international inquiry into the massacre of dozens of people found 
in a mass grave near Abidjan. Authorities have vowed to track down 
and punish those responsible for the killings. Witnesses blame the 
killings on security forces loyal to newly installed President Loran 
Gbagbo. Ouattara followers clashed last week with Gbagbo supporters 
after the outster of the country's military ruler. The Ouattara followers 
are calling for new elections saying last Sunday's vote was marred 
since Mr. Ouattara was debarred from running. Meanwhile, Abidjan is 
slowly returning to normal though tension remains as people across 
the city fear a return to violence. This is VOA News Now.
