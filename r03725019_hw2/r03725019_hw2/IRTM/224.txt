Thirty-three US sailors injured in the apparent terrorist attack that 
crippled the US navy destroyer Cole have returned to the United States 
after receiving medical treatment in Germany. They received an emotional 
greeting from family members who were brought to the Norfolk Navel 
Facility from all over the United States. Meanwhile, US officials 
vowed Sunday to be relentless in pursuing the perpetrators of Thursday's 
attack in the Yemeni port of Aden. Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral 
Vern Clark told the CBS broadcast 'Face the Nation' that US naval 
forces in the Middle East have now been reinforced. Security has been 
strengthened. We have additional security forces that have come to 
the ground. We have Admiral Mark Fitcher who is the task force Commander 
in there. We are bringing two or three additional ships into the region 
and they will be here within a next day or so. And so that on scene 
we are making great progress. But Defense Secretary William Cohen 
said investigators do not yet know who the culprits are.
