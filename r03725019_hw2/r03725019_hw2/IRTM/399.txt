In Yemen, a bomb threat has forced the tightening of security at the 
hotel housing US investigators probing the attack on the USS Cole. 
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters the situation caused the 
Secretary of Defense to call US field commanders. The Secretary held 
a video conference call with all the commanders in chiefs, as well 
as the service chiefs and the service secretaries and the topic was 
force protection. The hotel has been hosting scores of investigators 
who are looking into the apparent suicide bomb attack on the navy 
destroyer that killed 17 US sailor two weeks ago.
