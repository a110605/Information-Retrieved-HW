in the persian gulf tonight, american troops in kuwait and saudi arabia, 
10,000 of them, have been put on the highest state of alert. these 
are important places and the pentag said today it has picked up a 
credible terrorist threat. abc's john m wethy is at the pentagon night. 
he has been monitoring the salvage operation of the "uss cole." the 
navy today provided its own video of the "uss cole" being maneuvered 
onto the flooded deck of the giant salvage ship, the "blue marlin." 
as the "blue marlin's" ballast tanks were pumped out, its deck was 
raised beneath the crippled ship, lifting the "cole" out of the water. 
the 500-foot-long warship was placed aan angle so its propeller in 
the rear and its underwater sonar dome in the front would hang over 
the side. using steel braces, the "cole" is being welded to the deck 
of the "blue marlin" for the long ride home around africa. because 
of security concerns, it will not go through the suez canal. the navy 
estimates it will cost at least $150 million to repair the ship. but 
pentagon sources say damage, especially to the keel, may be greater 
than first believed. this $1 billion warship, officials warn, may 
have to be scrapped. as for cooperation between the u.s. and yemen, 
it seemed to break down completely today. yemen's government, apparently 
reacting to what it perceives as american arrogance, refused to allow 
any u.s. navy helicopters to land on its soil. that left american 
investigators stranded out on warships where they now live. and one 
more concern -- abc news has learned american officials now believe 
yemen authorities erased critical parts of a videotape taken by a 
harbor surveillance camera the day the "cole" was hit. increasingly, 
american officials wonder if yemen's government might have something 
to hide. john m wethy, abc news, the pentagon.
