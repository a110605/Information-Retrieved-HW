On the campaign trail, Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush 
is pledging to take a tough line against terrorists like the ones 
who bombed the USS Cole last week. VOA's David Swan reports. Mr. Bush 
joined President Clinton in paying tribute to 17 sailors who died 
when a terrorist bomb ripped open their ship. Speaking at a campaign 
stop at Wisconsin, the Governor said those responsible must be punished 
and he vowed to strike back if anything like this happens on his watch. 
Best way to stop terrorism is to send a chilling message. Yeah. Somebody 
would say what's that message going to be? And I'd say well, should 
I be the President, those who committed the act of terrorism we are 
going to find out and they are not going to like it. Mr. Bush also 
promised to bring a new tone to Washington in other ways to end what 
he calls a cynicism in name calling of the Clinton years. As he did 
on Tuesday night's televised debate, the Governor labeled his Democratic 
rival Al Gore, an agent of a bloated Federal government. The Bush 
campaign is quoting undecided and independent voters here in Wisconsin, 
one of several usually Democratic states where Republicans now believe 
they can win. David Swan, VOA News, Oklia, Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Mr. 
Gore promoted his program of more responsive government in Iowa and 
Michigan. The latest opinion polls indicate the two candidates are 
virtually tied.
