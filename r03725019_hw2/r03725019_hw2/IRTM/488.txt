in yemen tonight, four men are being questioned about their possible 
role in the attack on the "uss cole." the four, all yemenis, were 
picked up over the weekend by that country's police. u.s. officials 
describe them as "serious suspects," who were in touch with the suicide 
bombers in the day before the october 13th bombing. the fbi has not 
yet questioned them, however.
