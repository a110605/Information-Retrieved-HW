Vuk Draskovic, once Yugoslavia's foremost opposition leader, was booed 
off a stage by angry spectators Monday when he tried to address a 
student rally. Draskovic, whose Serbian Renewal Movement refused to 
support Vojislav Kostunica in last month's presidential elections, 
returned to Belgrade over the weekend after spending a year in Montenegro 
under the protection of that Yugoslav republic's pro-Western government. 
``Young people, I am back,'' Draskovic told the rally before the booing 
began. ``I came back to Serbia, scarred by the bullets of (Slobodan) 
Milosevic's regime.'' Instead of uniting with the rest of Serbia's 
opposition, Draskovic's party fielded its own candidate in the race 
for the Yugoslav presidency. He was accused of trying to split the 
opposition vote and thus weaken its chances of ending Milosevic's 
13-year reign. Draskovic's candidate, Vojislav Mihajlovic, lost disastrously. 
He garnered only 3 percent of the votes, compared to Kostunica's 53 
percent. The Serbian Renewal Movement also was crushed in the election 
for local councils, where the pro-democracy grouping won 80 percent 
of the votes. The defeat has led to calls from stunned party leaders 
for Draskovic to resign as party head. Draskovic led numerous violent 
protests against Milosevic's authoritarian rule in the early and mid-1990s. 
But after two assassination attempts in the past year _ which Draskovic 
said were organized by Milosevic _ he moved to the Montenegrin coastal 
resort of Budva. A year ago, a truck rammed Draskovic's car south 
of Belgrade. Draskovic was only slightly injured, but his brother-in-law 
and three bodyguards were killed. In June, gunmen opened fire at his 
home, grazing Draskovic and leaving him badly shaken.
