I am John Bershard, VOA News. Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee 
says his country is ill prepared for disasters such as Friday's earthquake 
in Western India. The quake is estimated to have killed 20,000 people. 
Mr. Vajpayee said he's forming a national agency to handle such calamities. 
He made the comments after touring the area Monday. In the town of 
Anjar this relative of a trapped person tells a reporter the man is 
digging himself out. We have given chisel and hammer also so that 
he himself can break the stones also. Whatever energy he is having 
now, that he's helping himself. So he's chipping away at a concrete 
block that is trapping his leg? Exactly, because no other person could 
reach up to that level. Elsewhere the focus is shifted from rescue 
to relief for people who have no food or shelter. Three ships and 
one special train are on their way to Gujarat with doctors, nurses, 
medicines, food, volunteers and bulldozers.
