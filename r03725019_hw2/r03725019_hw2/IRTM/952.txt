Four of the seven convicts who broke out of a Texas prison last month 
and allegedly gunned down a policeman on Christmas Eve were captured 
peacefully Monday in a foothills community south of Denver, authorities 
said. Another one of the inmates killed himself after barricading 
himself in a mobile home, Teller County Sheriff's Office said. The 
whereabouts of the two others were unknown.
