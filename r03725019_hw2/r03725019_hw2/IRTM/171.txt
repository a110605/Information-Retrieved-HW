hi. thank you for joining us this friday. we begin with the "uss cole" 
attack. investigators say there is increasing evidence terrorists 
were responsible for the explosion that killed as many as 17 sailors 
on the navy destroyer. ordnance experts have determined the blast 
came from an external source, most likely a small boat that pulled 
alongside the ship yesterday as it docked in a yemen port. divers 
who have examined the hull say the explosion left a hole 30 feet high 
and 40 feet wide. seven bodies have been recovered from the debris. 
ten sailors remain missing and are presumed dead. dozens of wounded 
survivors will be transported to hospitals in germany. the body ies 
of the victims are being brought back to the u.s. via germany after 
a stop at ramstein air base, they will be flown tomorrow to dell care. 
the military monday tans a mofrt wary facility at dover. the navy 
has released the names killed yesterday. they are -- surviving crew 
members are focusing their efforts on finding their comrades and keeping 
their ship seaworthy until it can be towed back to the u.s. they are 
very fatigued. they are working to find their missing shipmates. they 
are working and fighting for their ship and making sure that she is 
safe. and in fact, i'm happy to report that this morning things are 
stabilized. they have contained the flooding in all except the space 
that's open to the sea, in the hole that is visible in the pictures 
that have been shown to the public. so, an awful lot has gone on overnight.
