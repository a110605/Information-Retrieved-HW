From BBC News in London, I'm James Cawling for the World. The West 
African state of Ivory Coast has a new president. Veteran opposition 
leader Laurent Gbagbo has been sworn in just one day after the country's 
military ruler was ousted by a popular revolt. But violent clashes 
continue today as rival political factions continue to dispute the 
outcome of last Sunday's presidential election. The clashes are between 
the new president's followers and the supporters of a former Prime 
Minister Alassane Ouattara. Ouattara is demanding new elections. In 
most of the major cities, the turnout was not more than 20 percent, 
so this cannot be called a popular election. Ivory Coast deserves 
a president democratically elected. But Backbo supporters strongly 
reject the idea of re-running the elections. One of Backbo's most 
senior advisors Philip Jangonibi says new elections are out of the 
question. No, no we cannot accept a new election and we cannot accept 
to see the country burn. It is those who are demonstrating now who 
want the country to be burnt. And we don't want that. At least 20 
people are known to have been killed in today's violence. Unrest has 
reportedly spread to other cities outside Abidjan.
