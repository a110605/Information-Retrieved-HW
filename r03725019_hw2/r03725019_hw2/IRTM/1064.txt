His lawyers explored the possibilities, but President Bush has decided 
not to try to revoke some of the pardons granted by former President 
Clinton, a spokesman said Monday. ``While the president may not agree 
with the pardons that his predecessor put in place, his predecessor 
did make those decisions in accordance with his constitutional prerogatives,'' 
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said. As questions continued 
to swirl around Clinton's final-hours pardons, particularly that of 
fugitive financier Marc Rich, who had wealthy and influential ties 
to the Clinton White House, Fleischer acknowledged that Bush lawyers 
had looked into whether any options were open to Bush. Fleischer added: 
``President Bush will not explore whether or not he has the any authority 
to take any action in the case of his predecessor's pardons. The president, 
under the Constitution, has unfettered authority to grant pardons 
and that is President Bush's position.'' The press secretary was fuzzy 
on questions of which attorneys looked into Bush's options and under 
whose orders. ``The lawyers just started looking into things. ... 
It began with the Justice Department and lawyers, as lawyers do, they 
ask questions and think about things.'' Fleischer added that no formal 
legal report on the issue was presented to Bush. Rich, indicted in 
1983 by a federal grand jury on charges of evading more than $48 million 
in income taxes, has been living in Switzerland. He is ex-husband 
of Denise Rich, a major financial contributor to the Democratic Party. 
Rich's lawyer is former Clinton administration White House counsel 
Jack Quinn.
