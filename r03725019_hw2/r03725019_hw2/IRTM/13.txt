Opposition protests continue in Yugoslavia and President Slobodan 
Milosevic shows no signs of bowing to international pressure by stepping 
down. Now Russian President Vlademier Putin has offered to be a mediator 
in the Yugoslavia election crisis. Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow. 
In a written statement Vlademier Putin expressed concern of the mounting 
tension in Yugoslavia which he described as being fraught with unpredictable 
consequences. Since Russia was a true friend of Yugoslavia, the Russian 
President said he was prepared to step in as peace-maker and help 
mediate in the crisis. He invited both Slobodan Milosevic and Vojislav 
Kostunica to Moscow for talks. For days now the Russian authorities 
have been banging on Belgrade's door offering to help negotiate a 
peaceful resolution to the conflict. Steve Rosenburg, BBC News, Moscow.
