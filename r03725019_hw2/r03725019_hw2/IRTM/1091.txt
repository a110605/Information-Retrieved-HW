In western India Wednesday rescue workers pulled out more survivors 
of last Friday's earthquake just as bulldozers began breaking down 
the walls of wreaked buildings. Some officials worry that machines 
and explosives used to clear the debris would seal the fate of any 
survivors still trapped in the rubble. The confirmed death toll now 
stands at 12,000 with another 30,000 injured.
