I'm David Coller, VOA News. At least six US sailors were killed and 
more than 30 wounded, Thursday in an apparent suicide attack on a 
US warship in Yemen. VOA's Alex Belida reports from the Pentagon. 
The crew of destroyer USS Cole had no reason to expect trouble when 
the ship pulled into Aden harbor for a brief routine refueling stop. 
The crew, especially saw nothing to fear from a small support boat, 
sent out by harbor authorities to assist in the mooring process. But 
that small boat was apparently loaded with explosives and manned by 
suicide bombers. As it pulled up to the US destroyer, it blew up, 
tearing a gaping hole in the Cole's side. Admiral Vern Clark, the 
Chief of Naval operations, says there had been no threats or warnings 
ahead of the port call. He says other recently refueling visits by 
US ships to Aden had gone off without incident. Because of general 
concerns about security in the Mid East, armed guards had been posted 
on the ship's deck. Other standard safety and security measures were 
also being observed. Alex Belida, VOA News, the Pentagon.
