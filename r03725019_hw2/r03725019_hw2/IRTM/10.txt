yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic is warning of the consequences 
of an opposition victory in an upcoming runoff election. in a televised 
address today, milosevic predicted an opposition takeover would bring 
about the breakup of yugoslavia. milosevic's comments come as opposition 
forces are organizing nationwide strikes aimed at forcing him to step 
down. hundreds of cars, trucks and buses are lining up at major intersections, 
and most taxi drivers are refusing to work. opposition leaders claim 
milosevic rigged last week's presidential vote. overnight, thousand 
of workers abandoned their jobs at two important coal mines and an 
oil refinery, and that could lead to power and fuel shortages. yugoslav 
election officials have scheduled a runoff for sunday, saying milosevic's 
challenger, vojislav kostunica, didn't achieve the required majority 
of votes.
