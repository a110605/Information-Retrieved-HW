Divers searched water-filled compartments of the USS Cole on Monday 
and crews with powerful metal cutters tried to slice through the wreckage 
to reach more victims as sailors worked to stabilize their crippled 
warship. Conditions improved slightly for those aboard, with damaged 
electricity facilities restored to the point where the air conditioning 
could be turned on for the crew, said Lt. Terrence Dudley, spokesman 
for the U.S. 5th Fleet. Temperatures have been in the 90s in Aden, 
and the crew has been without air conditioning since the explosion 
Thursday that killed 17 sailors in a suspected act of terrorism. Other 
officials said exhausted Cole sailors were spending some time resting 
aboard two other Navy ships after working until dawn Sunday to keep 
the ship afloat when a bulkhead collapsed. Pressure variations had 
blasted open the bulkhead while sailors were draining areas of the 
ship, sending more water flooding in. Electrical shorts kept crews 
from using the regular pumps, so they jury-rigged a system using firefighting 
equipment. The crew was to receive a visit Monday from Gen. Tommy 
Franks, Tampa, Fla.-based commander of the U.S. Central Command. Franks 
was also scheduled to meet with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, 
officials said. There has been no credible claim of responsibility 
for the apparent suicide attack, which killed 17 sailors, wounded 
39 others and punched a 40-by-40-foot hole in the hull. Yemeni security 
forces have detained more than a dozen people for questioning, but 
no arrests have been announced. It ranks as the deadliest terrorist 
attack on the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks 
in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19. U.S. officials have suspended 
naval stops in Aden. The bodies of 10 victims remained missing. Crews 
were trying to reach the two visible and the 10 missing, perhaps trapped 
behind floors and walls bent wildly by the blast. In Virginia, doctors 
said some the injured would soon be released to go home. On Sunday, 
33 of the injured were flown from a U.S. military hospital in Germany 
where they received initial care to the Cole's home port, Virginia's 
Norfolk Naval Station. Six injured sailors remained hospitalized in 
Germany. Four will likely return to the United States on Tuesday or 
Wednesday, while the two others will stay for at least another week, 
Col. James Rundell, deputy director of the Landstuhl Regional Medical 
Center in western Germany, said Monday. Meanwhile, terrorism and explosive 
experts combed through scenes described by a U.S. official as ``utter 
devastation.'' On the deck, ``confetti size'' pieces from the wooden 
attack boat were collected, the official said. Among the tasks for 
the investigators: looking for residue that could indicate the type 
of explosives. One of the officials said the power of the blast suggested 
``more than just TNT'' _ which could suggest a well-organized and 
supplied group. The officials said the blast occurred shortly after 
the ship was secured to two buoys to begin refueling in the harbor, 
which was full of pleasure boats, fishing vessels and merchant ships. 
Two people on the attack boat reportedly stood at attention briefly 
before the explosion. The blast at the waterline was close to the 
dining area for senior enlisted officers. Most hands were busy finishing 
the docking. A few minutes later, however, and the mess area would 
have started to fill. Immediately after the explosion, the ship began 
to fill with oily water from the 40-foot deep harbor. The impact wrenched 
open hatches and buckled parts of the deck on the 4-year-old destroyer, 
whose modern construction may have helped it say afloat. Power was 
lost and generators were used to pump out water and keep the Cole 
afloat. The Cole will have to be moved from Aden for major repairs. 
A U.S. defense official said Monday the trip could begin in as soon 
as a few days, and would be made on the back of a vessel known as 
a heavy lift ship, like a floating dry dock capable of carrying ships 
of up to 30,000 tons. The unloaded Cole is 8,300 tons. U.S. diplomats 
have insisted the Yemeni government is not suspected of any terrorists 
links. But security has been a key issue regarding Aden, the home 
base for an Islamic militant group founded by the brother of Afghan-based 
terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden _ accused of links to the 1998 
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. 
Afghanistan's Taliban rulers denied bin Laden was involved, according 
to a Taliban statement published Monday in Pakistan's Urdu-language 
newspaper Jang. The Taliban said ``Osama cannot carry out such activities 
from Afghan territory.'' Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan 
since 1996 when he fled Sudan. The Taliban have refused to hand him 
over to the United States. Bin Laden has criticized Yemen for allowing 
U.S. ships to refuel at Aden. The United States keeps a small port-based 
security contingent in Aden, but relies mostly on Yemeni authorities. 
Washington is eager to strengthen relations with Yemen as another 
foothold in the Arab world. U.S. officials dismissed questions that 
security risks were overshadowed by political objectives when warships 
began refueling in Aden in June 1999. About 25 Navy vessels have used 
the port.
