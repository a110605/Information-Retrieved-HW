American tennis star Andre Agassi has successfully defended his Australian 
Open title with a dominating victory over Arnold Clement of France. 
The sixth seeded Agassi won the baseline battle in straight sets 6-4, 
6-2, 6-2 in a match that took a little more than an hour and a half. 
After winning his third Australian title and seventh Grand Slam event 
the 30-year-old Agassi said he was really ready to play well in Melbourne. 
Came into this week this tournament feeling like my game was very 
solid. I was in good position physically and then it did get better 
by each day. So winning it so special, defending it again didn't really 
occur to me till now and certainly it's a good feeling as well. Agassi 
also said winning a major never ceases to be overwhelming. He has 
now won four of the last nine major tournaments in tennis. The fifteenth 
seeded and 23-year-old Clement had never made it past the quarterfinals 
of a Grand Slam event but had defeated Agassi in their last two meetings. 
Clement said he was confident coming into the match. I was not very 
nervous but today was just too strong for me, too strong. I beat him 
two times and just with my game but today the game was higher and 
it was for me impossible to beat him today, impossible. The other 
winners in the two week Australian Open include American Jennifer 
Capriati in women's singles, sisters Venus and Serena Williams of 
the United States in women's doubles, Johnnes Yorkman of Sweden and 
Tom Woodridge of Australia in men's doubles.
