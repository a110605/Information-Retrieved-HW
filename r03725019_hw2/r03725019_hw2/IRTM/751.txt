Anke Huber has pulled out of the Australian Open because of injury. 
Huber has not played since spraining her right wrist in a doubles 
match in the U.S. Open in September. Last week, she also withdrew 
from the upcoming Australian women's hardcourt championships at Royal 
Pines. The Australian Open, the first Grand Slam tennis tournament 
of the year, begins Jan. 15.
