just before our last story, a brief review of the main one. the u.s. 
is bringing home most of its investigators from yemen. they've been 
investigating the atck on the "uss cole," but they tell us tonight 
that they have hit a brick wall. you can see from the damage on the 
"cole" today, these are the latest and closest pictures we've ever 
had, why they might be frustrated. investigators for the fbi wish 
the yemeni government would have let them interview more witnesses.
