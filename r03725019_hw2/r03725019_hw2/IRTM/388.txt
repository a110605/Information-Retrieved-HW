from russia tonight, word of a shocking discovery from the wreckage 
of that russian submarine. more than two months after a deadly explosion 
buried the "kursk" in the cold waters of the barents sea, a letter 
has surfaced. nbc's jim miklaszewski has the latest. today, ten weeks 
after a mysterious accident sent the "kursk" to the bottom of the 
barents sea, a grisly discovery -- norwegian and russian divers cut 
through the hull to find four bodies. in the pocket of one of the 
crew, a handwritten note, the dying words of a sailor who was trapped 
alive in the sunken sub. he's lieutenant-captain dmitry koleskinov, 
seen here three years ago aboard the kursk, but his last words tell 
a chilling tale of a desperate, but futile attempt to escape. in fact, 
it now appears at least 23 crew members survived the initial explosions 
that quickly filled the first five compartments with water, killing 
most of the 118-man crew instantly. the 23 frantically scramble to 
the rear of the sub. they find the escape hatch flooded and seal themselves 
into compartment nine. then, in total darkness and frigid cold, koleskinov 
realizing he will die begins to write -- koleskinov addressed the 
letter to his wife, olga. he's my dear, dear beloved. i want to see 
him again, i want to read his letter. the chilling account raises 
new questions and criticism of the russian navy, which waited several 
days before attempting to launch a rescue mission. but u.s. navy officials 
here at the pentagon believe any rescue mission would have failed, 
that there was really no hope for those 23 survivors. with no power, 
more than 300 feet down, it's believed any survivors would have frozen 
to death within hours, well before they ran out of air. that's of 
little consolation to the families who today hear the first and what 
made be the final words of the doomed crew of the "kursk. jim miklaszewski,
