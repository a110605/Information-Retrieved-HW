this election is about more than the presidency, of course. control 
of congress is at stake. in the house of representatives, republicans 
currently hold 223 seats, democrats, 210, and independents, 2. democrats 
must gain seven seats to claim power. and in the senate, republicans 
hold 54 seats, democrats, 46. democrats must take five additional 
seats to take the senate. some high-profile races there include hillary 
rodham clinton's battle with rick lazio in new york. in virginia, 
incumbent democrat chuck robb is in a tight race with republican george 
allen. and late missouri governor mel carnahan is still on the ballot. 
his widow has agreed to serve if he beats incumbent john ashcroft. 
in new jersey -- democrat jon corzine is expected to have spent about 
$60 million of his own money against republican bob franks, making 
it the most expensive senate race this year.
