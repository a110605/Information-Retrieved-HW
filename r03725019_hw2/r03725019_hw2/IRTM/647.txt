the navy now says it will cost about $240 million to get the "uss 
cole" up and running again. officials originally estimated it would 
cost $150 million to repair the gaping hole in the ship's midsection. 
but a naval official says that does not include the cost of replacing 
equipment and weapons damaged in the attack carried out by suicide 
bombers in yemen. the ship is scheduled to arrive in mississippi in 
about ten days.
