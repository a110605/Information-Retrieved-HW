From BBC news in London, I'm Gregor Cragey for The World. Washington 
has strongly condemned the military ruler of Ivory Coast, General 
Rober Gay. That's after Gay declared himself the victor in presidential 
elections. The Opposition in Ivory Coast say they are being robbed 
of the election. Rob Watson reports. The US has been making clear 
its displeasure with General Gay for weeks now, condemning his exclusion 
of Opposition candidates and expulsion of election observers. Now 
Washington has accused the General for what State Department spokesman 
Philip Reeca described as gross violation of democratic practice. 
He said the General had again violated the Constitution he had pledged 
to honor. The State Department is calling for the restoration of democracy 
in Ivory Coast, and has urged the military jauntier to respect the 
will of the people. Rob Watson, BBC News , Washington.
