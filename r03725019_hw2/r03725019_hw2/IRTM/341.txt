Russian weather forecasters say the storms that forced divers to suspend 
the Kursk submarine recovery mission should die down, later today. 
Bad weather in the Barent sea had forced suspension of recovery efforts. 
Earlier, Russian and Norwegian divers used underwater blow torches 
to cut a hole at the rear of the sub to extricate the bodies of 118 
sailors who died when two onboard explosions sent the sub to the ocean 
floor.
