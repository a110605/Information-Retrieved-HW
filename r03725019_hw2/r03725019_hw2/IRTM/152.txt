Right now let's get an update on the latest world news from VOA's 
Dave Deforest. Well Dick, US officials have launched an investigation 
into a suspected terrorist attack that killed at least six sailors 
on a US warship in Yemen. They say a suicide boat exploded near the 
USS Cole destroyer as it refueled early Thursday in the Yemeni port 
of Aden. The blast tore a huge gap in the ship's side. At least 10 
other crewmembers are missing more than 30 were injured. Defense Secretary 
William Cohen says if a formal investigation shows it was a terrorist 
attack. Dispatch investigators to learn what was responsible for the 
blast, tragedies that test our strength and our resolve occur and 
have occurred in the past. We have passed the test and measuring up 
to those responsibilities and we will pass that test once again today. 
Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Vern Clark says the bombers were 
aboard a small boat that was assisting in the refueling of the destroyer 
at the port. No one has claimed responsibility. US military forces 
around the world have been placed on high alert.
