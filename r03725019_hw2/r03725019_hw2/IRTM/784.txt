a report to be released thursday says a prison officer's failure to 
check identification allowed the escape of seven texas prison inmates. 
the chairman of the texas board of criminal justice says a disguised 
inmate was able to pose as a prison worker because of the lapse. but 
some guards charged the escape, just outside corpus christi, was made 
possible by staff shortages, poor pay and inadequate training. the 
inmates -- two convicted killers, two rapists, a child abuser, a kidnapper 
and a robber -- have been on the run since last month.
