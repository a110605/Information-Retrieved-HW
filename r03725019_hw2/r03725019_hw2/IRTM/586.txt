I'm David Coler, VOA News. Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has 
confirmed that he will resign by Tuesday. Peru's entire cabinet followed 
suit announcing it will step down as well. Mr. Fujimori made his announcement 
during a visit in Japan and it was unclear if he intends to return 
to Peru to tender his resignation. That resignation comes amid a corruption 
scandal involving Mr. Fujimori's fugitive ex-intelligence Chief Vladimiro 
Montecinos.
