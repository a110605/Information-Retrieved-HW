Former President Clinton drew cheers from admirers at a US Air Force 
base outside Washington today before departing for his home in New 
York. Prior to leaving office today Mr. Clinton issued more than one 
hundred presidential pardons. Among those pardoned was Susan McDoogle, 
a former business partner of Mr. Clinton who became a key figure in 
the White Water Real Estate investigation that plagued the Clinton 
Presidency.
