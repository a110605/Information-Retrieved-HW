And now Jim Stevenson joins us with a Sports update. Thank you very 
much Tony. Tennis is the big story of the day, the Australian Open, 
the first Grand Slam event of the season and third seed American Pete 
Sampras has survived a grueling four set match to defeat Carl Kuchera 
of Slovakia and advanced to the second round in Melbourne. The former 
world number one and winner of thirteen Grand Slam titles needed 3 
hours and 17 minutes to defeat Kuchera at scores 7-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 
in a night match on Center Court. Defending women's champion Lindsay 
Davenport of the United States and US Open men's champion and second 
seed Marat Safine of Russia also struggled in their opening matches. 
Safine ended up beating Galo Blocker of Spain 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 while 
the second seeded Davenport pounded five aces and came back from a 
first set loss to defeat Elana Dokic. Defending champion and sixth 
seed Andre Agassi of the United States encountered few problems in 
his first round match, he beat Czech player Yuri Wainek 6-0, 7-5 and 
6-3.
