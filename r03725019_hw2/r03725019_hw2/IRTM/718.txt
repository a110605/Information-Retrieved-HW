Army personnel in Vietnam are searching a suburb at the capital Hanoi 
for 18 unexploded bombs. They were dropped by US aircraft during attacks 
on the city over Christmas in 1972. Owen Beta-Jones reports. Vietnamese 
officials say that in 1972, during President Nixon's Christmas bombing 
offensive, 25 heavy bombs were dropped on two villages in Soxon district 
near Hanoi. Over the years, six of those bombs have been found and 
diffused. Officials say they now want to find the rest. Unexploded 
ordinance was one of the issues discussed during President Clinton's 
recent visit to Vietnam. He confirmed that the United States is now 
committed to help Vietnam clear the mines and bombs. Owen Beta-Jones,
