The battered US Navy destroyer Cole has begun its journey home from 
Yemen, 17 days after a suspected terrorist bomb tore a gapping hole 
in its side. The attack killed 17 American sailors and wounded 39. 
Flanked by other US warships and guarded by aircraft, the ship was 
towed out of Aden harbor to rendezvous with a huge Norwegian transport 
vessel that will carry the crippled ship back to the United States.
