a group of sailors are producing a cd to help the families of the 
navy men and women killed in the terrorist attack on the "uss cole." 
sandra hernandez reports. 77 don't you cry no more 77 77 don't you 
cry no more 77 long hours of fine tuning. 77 don't you cry 77 how 
did that sound? this is a singing group aboard the "uss john c. stemmos." 
these sailors felt compelled to pay tribute to the 17 men and women 
who died aboard the "uss cole." among those killed was san diego's 
own -- lakiba palmer. how many days after the incident did you actually 
sit down and write the lyrics? we wrote the lyrics in about 27 hours 
after it happened. how difficult was that dealing with some of the 
anger that you had and some of the frustration, the sadness? when 
you feeling anger, you automatically know what to write. it angers 
you, you know, and an anger builds up to the point where you know 
that you're defending your country and some of your men and women, 
you know, just got killed serving their purpose, you know, so it came 
out very real. it didn't take any thought. it just came from -- strictly 
from the heart. the featured song in the cd is titled "a mother's 
cry." 77 a mother's cry 77 it describes how children, period, in society 
can be lost and a mother -- and how a mother feels the pain of that 
lost child. the final version of the cd will include news reports 
from that fateful day. it's a sad day for america for the navy and 
for the families, of the lost and the wounded sailors. the sailors 
hope to raise $100,000 for the nine children of the sailors killed 
serving our country. that includes priscilla, palmer's 1-year-old 
daughter. each of the nine children left motherless or fatherless 
will receive $10,000 for a trust fund. with the support of -- that 
we get from the community around here, this can be something big. 
that was sandra hernandez reporting from affiliate kusi in san diego.
