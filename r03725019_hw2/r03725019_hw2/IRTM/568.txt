in vietnam today, the past hovered over president clinton's agenda. 
it was a day to address tragic and unfinished business. nbc's fred 
francis has our report. historic and moving president clinton, where 
one of america's 58,000 dies during the war. one of the missing in 
action.c as he walked up the sirs h@ nbc wcau-tv nbc wcau-t get onto 
the plane and he turned and he waved to us. that was the last time 
that we saw our father. david was 6 years old in 1967 when his pilot 
father was lost. today, he and his brother, dan, with the president 
in a rice paddy. we believe we owe them and americans like them what 
they came here for -- a chance, finally, to take their father home. 
this, clearly, the most poignant moment of the president's journeyny. 
when the jet was shot down, clinton was opposing the war. he died 
in the honor of his country. he -- i'm sure that he's grateful ha 
his sons are here to help bring him home. it was a moving moment. 
looking at the scraps thought to be captain evert's jet. moving for 
chelsea clinton, who brushed away a tear. to see if we can place captain 
evert at the time of impact. briefing her commander in chief, but 
honored to meet a family she was really working for. to meet the sons 
and to take that physical and personal connection. that meant a lot 
to me and the 20 years in the military. this is one of my finest times. 
for the vietnamese people, this visit is incredibly important. they 
look upon mr. clinton as a friend, less because he was opposed to 
the war and more because this is the man who ended the long economic 
and diplomatic isolation. and his visit here symbolizes any more than 
he ever could, that this country is open for business. fred francis,
