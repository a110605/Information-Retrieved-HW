The Yugoslavia opposition is urging its supporters to begin a civil 
disobedience campaign today to force President Slobodan Milosevic 
to concede defeat in last week's general elections. Protesters blocked 
several major roads in Serbia Sunday calling the actions dress rehearsals 
for the general strikes aimed at convincing Mr. Milosevic to relinquish 
power. Reports also say police sealed off the main pivot, Serbia's 
largest coalmine where a strike in support of the opposition threatened 
to plunge large parts of Yugoslavia into darkness. The opposition 
says its presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica won last week's 
general elections by an outright majority. The State Electoral Commission 
ordered an October 8th run off, saying neither Mr. Kostunica nor Mr. 
Milosevic won enough votes to avoid a run off. Former NATO commander, 
retired US General Wesley Walker predicts Mr. Milosevic's next move. 
It's a little too early for the international crisis stage. First, 
he is going to try to hold the elections down and move on into the 
second round and then he will finish the second round of the elections 
if he can. General Wesley Walker. US Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright says it's time for President Milosevic to step aside and 
let the political opposition do the many jobs it was elected to do. 
In an essay written for the US magazine Newsweek, Ms. Albright says 
Mr. Milosevic must go so the opposition can restore democracy, root 
out corruption and bring Serbia back into the European family of nations. 
She also writes that Western leaders stand ready to lift sanctions 
against the government in Belgrade, once a new and democratic administration 
is in place. The essay comes as Ms. Albright prepares to meet Monday 
in Paris with European Union Foreign Ministers for talks expected 
to focus on Yugoslavia's political crisis.
