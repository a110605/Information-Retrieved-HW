an investigation is under way to determine the cause of the plane 
crash that killed missouri governor mel carnahan, his son roger and 
a campaign aide. carnahan was en route to new madrid when the cessna 
335 went down last night 25 miles south of st. louis. the weather 
at the time was rainy and foggy, with zero visibility. witnesses told 
investigators the plane sounded like it was in a dive, then an explosion 
could be heard and the sky lit up. the popular democrat had served 
as governor since 1993 and was locked in a close race for the u.s. 
senate with republican john ashcroft. president clinton telephoned 
carnahan's wife, jean, today to express his condolences. carnahan 
was 66, his son roger, 44. campaign adviser chris sifford was 37. 
mourners are leaving behind notes, candles and flowers at the gate 
of the governor's mansion in jefferson city. one note honored carnahan 
as "a governor that believed in state employees." missouri's secretary 
of state says carnahan's name will remain on the ballot for the u.s. 
senate because it is too late to change it. in washington, senate 
minority leader tom daschle paid tribute. mel carnahan was a man of 
plain speech and enormous political courage. i believe he would have 
been a great united states senator, just as he was a great governor. 
his death is a loss to the people of missouri and to all americans. 
under missouri's constitution, lieutenant governor roger wilson becomes 
acting governor.
