Police battled demonstrators Thursday and black smoke billowed from 
parliament after security forces drove off mobs trying to storm the 
building to demand Slobodan Milosevic accept electoral defeat. Clashes 
spread through the streets of the capital, which echoed with the sound 
of stun grenades and tear gas fired to break up the crowds. Dozens 
of people were injured, according to witnesses. The melee erupted 
at the start of a huge rally the opposition called to force Milosevic 
to accept electoral defeat by Vojislav Kostunica in the Sept. 24 election. 
In what was apparently the largest anti-Milosevic protest since his 
13-year rule began, hundreds of thousands of people had assembled 
less than an hour before the rally was to begin, and tens of thousands 
more were seen streaming into the city.
