The Yemeni coastline, where the USS Cole met disaster in an apparent 
terrorist bombing last week, is a ``sieve'' for terrorists but was 
the best option available for refueling Navy ships in the volatile 
region, the former U.S. military commander in the region said Thursday. 
Gen. Anthony Zinni, who was commander in chief of U.S. Central Command 
at the time the Pentagon contracted for refueling services in the 
Yemeni port of Aden in December 1998, took responsibility for the 
decision. ``I pass that buck on to nobody,'' Zinni told a Senate Armed 
Services Committee hearing.
