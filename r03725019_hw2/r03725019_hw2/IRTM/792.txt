An exiled former president and 16 others have registered to enter 
Peru's April 8 presidential vote, kicking off the race to replace 
disgraced former President Alberto Fujimori. Political parties rushed 
Monday to register their candidates with the National Elections Board 
before a midnight deadline. Among the hopefuls was front-running opposition 
leader Alejandro Toledo, a U.S.-trained economist whose powerful speeches 
rallied tens of thousands of Peruvians in protest of Fujimori's authoritarian 
rule. Another was exiled former President Alan Garcia, whose populist 
1985-90 administration was marred by hyperinflation, guerrilla violence 
and corruption. Garcia, a fiery orator who still faces arrest here, 
fled to Colombia in 1992 amid corruption charges. His left-leaning 
Aprista party has been pressuring the courts to halt legal action 
against him. Election officials registered of 10 candidates from established 
political parties. Meanwhile, candidates from seven new parties were 
accepted conditionally. Fujimori called elections for this April, 
cutting short his third five-year term to only one year, after the 
release in September of a video showing his fugitive ex-spy chief 
Vladimiro Montesinos apparently bribing a congressman. Fujimori later 
fled to Japan, his ancestral homeland, amid ensuing corruption scandals, 
and was replaced by interim President Valentin Paniagua, whose mandate 
is to hold clean election in April and turn power over to a new government 
next July.
