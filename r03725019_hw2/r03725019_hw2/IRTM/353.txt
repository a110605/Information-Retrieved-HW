in missouri, the question is will the dead man win? governor roger 
wilson says, if the late governor mel carnahan, who is still on the 
ballot, wins more votes than senator john ashcroft on november he 
will appoint mr. carnahan's widow, jean, to the senate if he she wants 
it. mr. carnahan was killed in a plane crash last week.
