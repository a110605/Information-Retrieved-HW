attorney general nominee john ashcroft will be introduced at his confirmation 
hearing next week by democratic senator jean carnahan. she was appointed 
to the senate after ashcroft was defeated by her late husband, missouri 
governor mel carnahan, who was killed shortly before the election 
in a plane crash. carnahan hasn't said whether she will support ashcroft's 
nomination. but republicans say her decision to do the introduction 
is a positive signal.
