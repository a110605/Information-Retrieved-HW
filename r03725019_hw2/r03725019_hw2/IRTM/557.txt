In a historic speech, President Clinton has addressed the people of 
Vietnam, urging them to work with Americans to heal the wounds of 
war. The President also spoke of the staggering sacrifice of the 3 
million Vietnamese soldiers and civilians who died during the conflict. 
Let us continue to help each other heal the wounds of war, not by 
forgetting the bravery shown and the tragedy suffered by all sides, 
but by embracing the spirit of reconciliation and the courage to build 
better tomorrows for our children. President Clinton also raised the 
issue of human rights but went on to stress the US was not trying 
to impose its own ideals. You have already shown the world he said 
that Vietnam takes it's own decisions
