we'll begin with the "uss cole." there has been the first break in 
the case. morton dean reports in yemen. the investigation into the 
attack which crippled the ship took a positive turn when yemenis investigators 
discovered bombmaking equipment in a house said to be close to the 
port where the ship is anchored. the two men who briefly lived in 
the house are reportedly missing. yemenis authorities say the men, 
not believed to be yemenis, are linked to the attack. eyewitnesses 
say the attack was caused by two men on a suicide mission. u.s. sources 
confirm key details of the report tonight, but ambassador barbara 
bodine would only say the investigation is progressing. throughout 
this investigation we're going to be making significant progress day 
to day and certainly from yesterday to today, it has been a quantum 
leap. how destructive the bomb was became even more painfully apparent 
today. six more bodies have been recovered. they had been trapped 
in a tangled mass of steel above and below the water line. six sailors 
are still missing. the horror and the heroics on the "uss cole," when 
the massive bomb ripped through the ship, were relived this evening 
by one of the crew, lieutenant ann chamberlain. i just felt a large 
-- not so much a bang, but it seemed, to me, from where i was, it 
seemed like something had rammed the ship. now that vestigators have 
had their first major break, the confidence level here has risen, 
but u.s. officials still warn a long investigation lies ahead. morton 
dean, abc news, yemen. we will have live coverage of tomorrow's memorial 
service for the sailors who died on the "uss cole," eastern time.
