Russian and Norwegian divers searched the fourth compartment of the 
wrecked submarine Kursk, Sunday. But they found too much damage to 
proceed with the task of recovering bodies. A spokesman for Russia's 
Northern Fleet says the divers were only able to venture about one 
meter into the compartment because of poor visibility.
