And right now let's get the latest world news. I am David Coller, 
VOA News. Ivory Coast's newly elected President Loran Gbagbo plans 
to announce his government today. Mr. Gbagbo has ruled out new elections, 
but is promising to set up what he calls a broad-based government 
of national unity. In Washington State Department Spokesman, Phil 
Reeker said new elections are necessary. The election October 22nd 
was failed and fundamentally flawed from the outset due to the exclusion 
of major party candidates and other machinations leading up to the 
election. It's going to be very important for the voices of the dissent 
franchise Ivorians to be heard and in that sense the holding of free, 
fair and inclusive elections will be needed to fully restore the government 
or put to fore its legitimacy and bring democracy back to . Fresh 
violence broke out Thursday between the Gbagbo supporters and backers 
of rival opposition leader Alassane Ouattara, who was barred from 
Sunday's voting. At least 20 people were killed.
