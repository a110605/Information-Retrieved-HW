the navy finished its investigation on the attack of "uss cole" in 
yemen last october. the results will be made paubl tomorrow. we know 
the results tonight. here's abc's john m wethy. a ship that had won 
commendations for being vigilant during port visits in the mediterranean 
seemed to be anything but vigilant when it steamed into yemen's port 
of aden. navy investigators have found the captain, commander kirk 
lippold, and his crew failed to take about a dozen required steps 
to protect the ship. there was no officer on the bridge to coordinate 
lookouts, no orders to identify and keep the track of small boats 
near the ship, no measure to divert a small boat if it seemed suspicious, 
and no audiotape in arabic to warn a boat away. the navy's investigating 
officer has concluded if all of these steps had been taken, it "may 
have prevented or mitigated the attack." but various admirals up the 
chain of command concluded just the opposite, even if all of these 
step hz been taken, they probably would have not stopped the terrorists. 
it now seems likely commander lippold, the cole's captain, will not 
be disciplined but others will still be in trouble. defense secretary 
cohen ordered another inquiry to see if some of the admirals who reviewed 
the investigation might bear some responsibilities themselves. john
