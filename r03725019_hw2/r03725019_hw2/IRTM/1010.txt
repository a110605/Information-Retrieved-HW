the williams sisters may have both lost to martina hingis in the women's 
draw at the australian open, but they aren't leaving melbourne without 
any hardware. this, after taking the doubles title over lindsay davenport 
and corina morariu. i can't imagine playing with anyone else. and 
it's just the way it is. we do so well together to know that no matter 
what i do out there, serena is always going to be behind me and there 
for me. yeah, we really just like to play with each other. we really 
get along since we were -- we never fight. so we don't have that -- 
we never really had that option. andre agassi will play for the men's 
title against arnaud clement, who rallied from down two sets to beat 
fellow frenchman sebastien grosjean. jerome jurenovich, "cnn headline
