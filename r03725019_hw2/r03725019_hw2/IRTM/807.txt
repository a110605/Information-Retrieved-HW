the search for seven escaped convicts continues in texas. authorities 
are posting roadblocks near the mexican border. meanwhile, prison 
officials have reconstructed the breakout and say they now know what 
went wrong. alexa lee reports. the escape, now being called one of 
the most intricate breakout plans in state history, occurred in the 
span of 2 1/2 hours. it included a strategy of overpowering guards 
and staff one-by-one, stealing weapons and clothes, and then driving 
off the grounds of the connally unit in kenedy, texas. in retrospect, 
the events of december 2000, fit together like a puzzle. we just didn't 
put the pieces together fast enough. the texas department of criminal 
justice released a 16-page report detailing how seven convicts escaped 
on december the fugitives, considered extremely dangerous, are wanted 
for the shooting death of a police officer on christmas eve. among 
numerous security breakdowns cited, the report includes the failure 
of a back gate guard to get proper identification before letting the 
inmates into a guard tower. the inmates had pretended to install security 
cameras. what should have happened was they should have been identified 
before the gates were ever opened. the inmates also took 11 employees 
and 3 prisoners hostage in an electrical circuit room, stripped them, 
and bound them with tape and plastic ties. another guard was also 
taken hostage at a different location. texas corrections officials 
say they have no evidence a staff shortage is to blame. the mother 
of slain officer aubrey hawkins is calling for accountability and 
responsibility rather than finger-pointing. and let's waste no more 
time. other people will most likely get hurt in capturing these people. 
it's gonna break my -- my heart is already broken. alexa lee, "headline
