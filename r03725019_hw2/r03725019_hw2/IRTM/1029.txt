finally from us tonight, growing up. that's really what jennifer cap 
riads story is about. as the australian open women's tennis championship, 
her first masters. it took her two quick sets and ten difficult years 
to get there. the jennifer capriati who took the court last night 
was all grown up. there she was again, as she had been a decade before, 
pounding the ball, pounding an opponent, defeating handily the number 
one player in the world, martina hingis. i'm no longer going to doubt 
myself in anything now. if i could come home with a gnd slam, you 
know, then i know for sure that anything is possible. this was destiny 
delayed. at 14 she was, she was told, the future of american tennis. 
the next tracy austin. the next chris evert. the next american sweetheart. 
child living in an adults' world, perfection required. adolescence 
intervened. under the weight of expectation and unwanted fame, in 
full teenage rebellion, she dropped out of tennis in 1993. and so 
this is how many remember jen -- a mug shot after a marijuana bust, 
which had followed an arrest for shoplifting. she was out of control, 
miserable, and it showed. the road back has been tough. there were 
tears at a press conference two years ago when she was looking forward 
and porters were looking back. i just wish i didn't have to talk about 
this stuff. but last night in melbourne, she was finally fit and strong 
and grown up and confident enough to act like the child that was almost 
lost. a hug for her father and coach. but this moment was not for 
him or anyone else. this time, perhaps for the first time, jen won 
for jen. who would have thought i would have ever made it here after 
so much has happened? but, you know, dreams do come true, and you 
just keep believing in yourself, and anything can happen. the score, 
6-4, 6-3, capriati of course.
