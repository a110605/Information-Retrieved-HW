The bombing of a U.S. warship and increasing violence in the Middle 
East prompted the State Department to close many of its embassies 
and consulates for the weekend. All posts in the Middle East, the 
Persian Gulf region and north Africa will be closed to public business 
until Monday, as will those in Nigeria, Tanzania, Senegal, Mauritania, 
Djibouti, South Africa, Kenya, Pakistan and Sierra Leone. In each 
case, U.S. personnel will remain on the job to look out for the interests 
of Americans, the department said. The announcement came a day after 
the USS Cole, one of the Navy's most advanced warships, was bombed 
during a refueling stop in Yemen and violence increased in Israel, 
Gaza and the West Bank.
