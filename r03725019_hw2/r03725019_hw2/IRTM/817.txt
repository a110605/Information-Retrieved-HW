turning to other news in el salvador. damage reports are just starting 
to come in after a massive earthquake that shook buildings 600 miles 
away in mexico city. it measured 7.6 on the richter scale, causing 
land slides and devastation. at least 32 are confirmed dead. just 
minutes ago i spoke to u.s. ambassador rose likins, who is in the 
country's capital of san salvador. as many as 200 homes had been buried 
by a land slide. they have just asked us for assistance in helping 
to dig out that community. we also have reports of a collapsed hospital 
in a town called san miguel. a church that collapsed during a service 
in a town called santa anna. will the embassy be making any sort of 
preparation to move american citizens ouof that area should they request 
help in evacuating? absolutely. we're standing by. we have a fairly 
good enough of our staff on duty in the embassy right now, taking 
calls from americans trying to be in touch with their families, but 
reports of damages to their homes. as i said earlier, we have no reports 
so far of americans who have been killed and really no serious injuries 
up to now. all right, ambassador likins from san salvador, thank you 
so much for joining us.
