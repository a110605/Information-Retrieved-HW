With most candidates barred, the two largest parties boycotting, and 
a military ruler seeking to entrench his power as a civilian, residents 
of this West African nation trickled to polling stations Sunday to 
elect a new president. The voting came 10 months after an army coup 
brought a junta to power, sparking a series of political crises and 
leaving this nation's reputation for political tranquility in shreds. 
Junta leader Gen. Robert Guei faces serious competition from just 
one of his four opponents in the controversial vote; history professor 
and longtime opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo. Most candidates, including 
those from the country's two largest political parties, were disqualified 
last month by the Supreme Court. The United Nations, the Organization 
of African Unity, the European Union and countries such as the United 
States and Canada have withdrawn election observers or funding, saying 
the exclusion of major opponents have made a truly free and fair election 
impossible. Although national figures were not yet available, voting 
appeared light at polling stations in a number of Ivorian cities, 
with most reporting less than 30 percent turnout by early afternoon. 
Voters were nearly nonexistent in many parts of Korhogo, the main 
city in the north and a stronghold of support for the now-disqualified 
opposition leader, Alassane Dramane Ouattara. ``As you can see, the 
north is sleeping through this election,'' polling worker, Drissa 
Dialo said at one empty voting station. Ouattara's Rally of the Republicans 
(RDR) and the former ruling Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast (PDCI), 
whose candidates were also excluded by the court, have both called 
for a boycott of the polls. The chief justice of the Supreme Court 
has close ties to Guei, who had insisted in December that he would 
quickly cede power to a civilian. ``The general came to sweep the 
house (clean), but he didn't leave, he didn't keep his promise,'' 
said Bema Coulibaly, a Korhogo resident who said he wouldn't be voting 
Sunday. Campaigning has been muted in Ivory Coast. Guei (pronounced 
GAY-ee), whose own soldiers have staged two mutinies since the coup 
and who, officials say, survived an assassination attempt in September, 
has barely appeared in public, apparently fearful of his security. 
But while he has thrown the weight of the junta behind his election, 
Guei has insisted he will step down if he loses. ``Ivory Coast is 
a country of peace, where everything takes place in serenity,'' he 
said Sunday after voting amid heavy security at a primary school near 
his house, in an upscale Abidjan neighborhood. Guei has seen his popularity 
wane since the December coup, when cheering crowds filled the streets 
of some neighborhoods to welcome the ouster of President Henri Konan 
Bedie, who was widely seen as corrupt and ethnically divisive. But 
for some Ivorians, Guei is still seen as the only candidate who can 
control Ivory Coast's politically divided and often-thuggish security 
forces. ``Without him, there would have been civil war,'' said Nicodeme 
Zan, a voter in Abidjan. Gbagbo (pronounced BAHG-bo), for his part, 
said he believed most of Ivory Coast's 5.5 million registered voters 
would oppose Guei, who for many remains a soldier _ albeit one who 
now sports a suit and tie. ``In Ivory Coast's present state, I find 
it unlikely that they will vote in a military man to head the government,'' 
he said just before casting his ballot. Many of his supporters are 
already referring to Gbagbo as ``president,'' and some have warned 
they will take to the streets if he is not declared the winner. ``The 
soldiers have done their job now and they must go back to the barracks,'' 
said Jean-Pierre Nassoue, 35, who writes for a true-crime magazine. 
``It doesn't matter who wins, just not a soldier.'' Ouattara, the 
country's best-known opposition candidate, was excluded after the 
Supreme Court said there were questions over whether both his parents 
were of ``Ivorian origin,'' as a new junta-backed constitution requires. 
The past year has seen Ivory Coast suffer through a series of crises, 
including the two military mutinies and a further erosion of the country's 
economy, already battered by a steep decline in prices for its primary 
exports, cocoa and coffee. The instability has frightened Ivorians 
and foreign investors alike. To win Sunday's election, a candidate 
must capture more than 50 percent of the vote or a run-off will be 
held 15 days after the first-round results are officially declared. 
Early results from the election are expected late Sunday or early 
Monday.
