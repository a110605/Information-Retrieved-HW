US Defense Secretary William Cohen plans to travel next week to nine 
Middle Eastern Gulf states for meetings with regional leaders. Mr. 
Cohen will depart next Tuesday to visit Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, 
Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel, Jordan and Egypt. The 
Pentagon says, the Secretary will consult with defense officials in 
those countries and also visit US troops in the area. US forces in 
the Gulf have been on high alert, since last month's apparent terrorist 
bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 sailors. An explosion struck 
the Cole, as it refueled in the Yemeni port of Aden.
