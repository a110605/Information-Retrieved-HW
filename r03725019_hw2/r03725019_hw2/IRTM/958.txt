fbi and state authorities are stepping up their manhunt for two remaining 
texas fugitives after the capture of four others in woodland park, 
colorado, yesterday. just outside colorado springs. george rivas has 
now confessed to the shooting of a dallas area police officer on christmas 
eve. the four men under arrest now are expected to be arraigned today 
at the telar county jail where they were taken after their capture. 
agents say the two other prison escapees, patrick murphy jr. and donald 
newbury, are "heavily armed and dangerous." police have surrounded 
what is apparently the getaway car, a brown ford conversion van in 
colorado springs. it's not clear whether indeed that was the getaway 
vehicle. they are said to be in a late or early brown or maroon conversion 
van, possibly a ford, with white curtains on the side and back windows. 
the truth is we don't know where they headed. i mean, they could go 
to any part or they could go deep under in the city of denver. it's 
unknown at this time. we are very patient. we're working with the 
public, police agencies, not only throughout the state of colorado 
but throughout the region in an attempt to locate them. authorities 
say a seventh fugitive, larry harper, committed suicide yesterday 
after barricading himself inside a trailer.
