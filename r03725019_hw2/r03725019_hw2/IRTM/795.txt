The prison where seven heavily armed inmates escaped last month was 
short-staffed by almost two dozen guards on the day of the breakout, 
according to a union official. Brian Olsen, deputy director of the 
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, conceded 
that guards made mistakes during the escape, but criticized the Legislature 
for failing to address staff shortages. ``I am still under the belief 
that lack of staffing is at the root of the problem,'' Olsen told 
The Dallas Morning News. ``Someone has to take some responsibility, 
and I think it's at the Capitol.'' State Sen. John Whitmire said Olsen's 
criticisms were ill-advised. ``I quite frankly don't believe now is 
the proper time to be discussing blame for the escape. Everyone's 
attention should be on the capture and placing these individuals back 
in prison,'' he said. Olsen said the Texas Department of Criminal 
Justice's Connally Unit in Kenedy was 22 officers short. Glen Castlebury, 
a Department of Criminal Justice spokesman, acknowledged the likelihood 
of vacancies, but said he was unsure how many the prison might have 
had. State prison officials have identified lax security, including 
a guard's failure to request identification from one inmate as he 
approached the guard tower, as a significant factor in the escapes. 
The manhunt for the prisoners has intensified in recent weeks, in 
the wake of a Christmas Eve robbery at a sporting goods store allegedly 
committed by the inmates. A police officer was killed in the robbery.
