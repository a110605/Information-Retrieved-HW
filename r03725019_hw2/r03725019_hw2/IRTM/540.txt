President Bill Clinton has become the first US President to visit 
Vietnam in 31 years. A small number of Vietnamese officials, including 
Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien, greeted Mr. Clinton and his daughter 
Chelsea as they stepped off the plane at Hanoi. Although the official 
welcoming ceremony will not occur until Friday morning, thousands 
of Vietnamese gathered on the road from the airport and thousands 
more jammed a square in front of Mr. Clinton's hotel. The President 
will stay in Vietnam for three days, culminating a process of normalizing 
relations that began early in Mr. Clinton's first term in office, 
eight years ago.
