after months of upheaval and years of controversy, the reign of peru's 
often autocratic president alberto fujimori is near an end, here's 
abc's bill blakemore. today, peru's president fugimori was holed up 
behind tight security in a hotel in tokyo japan. he made a sudden 
trip there friday on his asian tour. alberto fujimori has kept close 
ties to japan, where his son and sister now live. his ten-year rule 
has been crumbling in recent months, stemming from charges he stole 
the election, and the release of a videotape, showing his intelligence 
chief apparently bribing politicians. union-led protesters have been 
demanding a return of human rights and democracy. fugimori's planned 
resignation, announced this morning, coming after his opposition gained 
firm control of the congress a few days ago. he said nothing about 
the rumors in peru that he will seek asylum in japan. fugimori has 
asked the vice president to take over until elections in april. tonight, 
it's not clear if peru's congress will accept that arrangement. bill
