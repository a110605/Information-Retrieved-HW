congress is investigating former president bill clinton's pardon of 
fugitive financier mark rich. yesterday, house government reform committee 
chairman dan burton asked for documents in the case. burton says clinton 
has not adequately explained his decision. rich's ex-wife, songwriter 
denise rich, has given more than $1 million to the democratic party. 
she said there is no connection between the money and the successful 
campaign to pardon rich. rich had been on the justice department's 
list of the six most wanted international fugitives. he fled to switzerland 
prior to being indicted in 1983 on charges of tax fraud.
