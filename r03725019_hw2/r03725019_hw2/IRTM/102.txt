Ivory Coast's main opposition leader promised Saturday to continue 
a peaceful fight for democracy, remaining defiant despite a court 
decision that barred him from running against the country's junta 
leader in upcoming presidential elections. In a veiled threat to the 
West African nation's military junta, opposition leader Alassane Dramane 
Ouattara said the regime is incapable of ``subverting the will of 
the people'' despite Friday's Supreme Court ruling. Twenty candidates 
had submitted applications to participate in the Oct. 22 election, 
called to restore civilian rule. But only five, including junta leader 
Gen. Robert Guei, were found eligible to run, according to the court 
decision read late Friday. Ouattara was rejected along with former 
president Henri Konan Bedie, the leader ousted by the military junta 
last winter, and ex-Cabinet minister Emile Constant Bombet, who now 
heads the former ruling party. Some Ouattara supporters had warned 
of civil unrest if he was excluded. Junta officials had countered 
with threats of harsh reprisals for any violence. On Saturday, Ouattara 
accused Guei of ``buying'' the decision from court chief Kone Tia, 
the junta leader's former attorney. He called Tia ``one of the most 
corrupt judges in Ivory Coast.'' Ouattara urged his supporters to 
remain calm, instructing them in a statement to ``preserve our dear 
Ivory Coast from violence and to assure that the peace to which we 
are all attached is not threatened.'' But he warned that public anger 
over the decision could still explode. ``We know from Serbia what 
happens when the will of the people is being ignored,'' he said, referring 
to the opposition uprising in Yugoslavia that toppled President Slobodan 
Milosevic. ``One cannot predict what will happen in Ivory Coast.'' 
There were no immediate signs of unrest in Ivory Coast, where a state 
of emergency and nighttime curfew have been in effect since Friday. 
In Abidjan, the country's commercial capital, many stores were closed 
and there were fewer people in the streets than usual. But buses were 
running normally and security forces kept a low profile. In the streets 
surrounding Ouattara's hulking Abidjan mansion, where hundreds of 
supporters have camped out for weeks, young men wearing bandannas 
and white T-shirts reinforced sandbag barriers while chanting ``Ado,'' 
a popular nickname for Ouattara. ``If Ado tells us to die, we will 
die. We are just waiting for orders of what to do next,'' said one 
of the protesters, 24-year-old Mamadou Fofana. In its ruling, the 
Supreme Court said it had doubts about the nationality of Ouattara's 
mother and argued that the opposition leader had repeatedly used the 
nationality of neighboring Burkina Faso. Ivory Coast's new constitution 
requires that both parents of a presidential candidate be Ivorian-born 
and bars candidates that have used another nationality. Ouattara insists 
he meets those qualifications. With the exclusion of Ouattara and 
other major figures, Guei faces only one well-known politician, Laurent 
Gbagbo, a longtime opposition leader who has lost several previous 
election bids. ``Guei has assembled a team to run with him instead 
of against him,'' said Ouattara, saying none of the other contenders 
are threats to the military leader. After seizing power in the coup 
_ Ivory Coast's first _ Guei initially promised a quick handover to 
civilians. But he has since traded his military uniform for a suit 
and tie and has rallied several small political parties around his 
candidacy despite international calls to step down. The December coup 
shook Ivory Coast's standing as a stable financial and political power. 
The country has sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest economy, dependent 
on exports of coffee and cocoa.
