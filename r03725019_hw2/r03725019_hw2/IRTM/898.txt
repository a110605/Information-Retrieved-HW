jerome jurenovich, "cnn headline sports." for all of you who feel 
professional athletes make too much money, refreshing reaction from 
two of the best, following complaints by yevgeny kafelnikov that tennis 
players are underpaid. my feelings are he should take his prize money 
when he's done here and go buy some perspective. i think we're all 
overpaid. i mean -- yeah, i mean, we play a sport and we get paid 
very well. and i'm not complaining about the prize money. i don't 
play for the prize money. i play for the titles, and yevgeny definitely 
plays every week, so, you know what he likes. laughter sampras did 
advance at the australian open on friday, although he had to rally 
to do it after dropping the first two sets to argentina's juan ignacio 
chela. second seed marat safin also moved on as did agassi. on the 
ladies side -- lindsay davenport, anna kournikova and jennifer capriati 
are onto the fourth round as well. jerome jurenovich, "cnn headline
