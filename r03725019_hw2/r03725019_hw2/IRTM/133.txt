An apparent suicide terrorist bombing tore into a U.S. Navy destroyer 
Thursday, killing four Americans, injuring three dozen and leaving 
12 missing, the Defense Department said. Authorities said the explosion 
was triggered by a small boat that had pulled alongside the ship as 
it was docked in the Arabian Peninsula. President Clinton said the 
attack on the USS Cole appeared to be an act of terrorism. ``We will 
find out who was responsible and hold them accountable,'' he pledged. 
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, U.S. officials said.
