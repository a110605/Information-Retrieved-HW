in tennis -- greg rusedski continued his dominance over gustavo kuerton. 
rusedski who has beaten kuerten four of the last five times. he needed 
close to three hours to beat the top seed, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 2-6, 9-7. 
i think it is probably my greatest victory by far. i mean, i've never 
beaten a number one player in the world on a stadium court at a grand 
slam ever. so for me, that's something very special. anthony keith
