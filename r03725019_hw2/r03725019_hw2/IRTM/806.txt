Texas prison officials have issued a report following the escape of 
7 inmates. The men have been on the run since December 13. Janet Hymlek 
reports from Austin. The 7 escapees were housed at the maximum-security 
Connoly Unit prison near San Antonio. According to the report, they 
made their move while working in the maintenance area at lunchtime. 
There the men overpowered a supervisor and bound and gagged him and 
then did the same to 9 other employees and 3 inmates. Some of the 
men then put on uniforms of the Down-Correctional officers, which 
allowed them to walk around pretty freely. After that, they overtook 
an officer in a security tower and when they got to a back gate a 
guard failed to ask them for ID's. This helped them to steal a truck 
and make their getaway. Prison officials largely blamed the escape 
on the officer at the back gate, but guards say they are being scapegoated. 
They say prison officials have not taken proper precautions to protect 
their safety. For NPR News I am Janet Hymlek in Austin.
