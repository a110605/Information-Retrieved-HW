Peter Kothari began early Friday morning trying to call relatives 
in India to learn whether they all were safe from the devastating 
earthquake that killed more than 2,000 people. ``The first thing they 
said was, 'We are OK,''' he said. ``That was the major thing I wanted 
to hear.'' Several Indian cultural groups and associations in the 
United States began organizing relief efforts Friday to aid the quake-stricken 
area. Kothari, who is president of the Indo-American Cultural Association, 
was to fly Friday night to India. Once just a family visit, his trip 
will now be spent helping coordinate aid efforts. ``We are fearing 
thousands and thousands to be dead and injured,'' he said. ``At this 
moment we are trying to figure out what we can do and what we should 
do.'' President Bush offered condolences to the victims and said the 
United States is willing to provide assistance ``as needed and desired 
by the governments'' of both India and Pakistan. As an initial donation, 
the U.S. ambassador to India, Richard Celeste, is able to provide 
$25,000 from a fund to be used in emergency situations. Providian 
Financial Corp. in San Francisco donated $10,000 to relief efforts. 
The chairman and CEO of the credit card company, Shailesh Mehta, is 
from Mumbai, India, and has family there. ``Hopefully our small gesture 
will start momentum,'' he said in an interview later. Jeevan Zutshi, 
an engineer and real estate developer who heads the Indo-American 
Community Foundation in Fremont, Calif., said his organization of 
more than 500 people is prepared to give aid and resources to the 
quake victims as soon as possible. ``The community has really gone 
gung-ho in sending support,'' he said. ``We will be doing all the 
things that have to be done.'' In Albany, N.Y., Dr. Maninder Gujral 
said the Sikh community in the area would likely mount a relief effort. 
``The infrastructure there is not that strong,'' Gujral said. ``Something 
like this, you're not going to be able to get through.'' The Asian 
American Hotel Owners Association, headquarters in Atlanta, is asking 
members to send donations to the American Red Cross, which has launched 
relief efforts in the Gujarat state, where the quake was centered. 
The nonprofit organization has nearly 7,000 members in the U.S. and 
Canada, according to office coordinator Faye Jacobson. ``Many of our 
members come from Gujarat or have family there,'' she said Friday 
night. ___ On the Net: State Department Emergency Services to U.S.
