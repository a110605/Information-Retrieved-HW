hi. good afternoon. our top story this half hour -- local authorities 
say the death toll is 1,100 and growing after a magnitude 7.9 earthquake 
struck western india. northwestern india. hardest hit was ahmedabad, 
a city of nearly 8 million people. pictures from the scene show dozens 
of collapsed buildings. authorities say they fear aftershocks will 
bring down even more structures. the quake is believed to be the most 
powerful to hit the country in 51 years. satinder bindra is in india 
and describes the rescue efforts. i've just come back from a few sites 
where soldiers are digging away furiously, many with their own hands. 
the building i was at, i managed to pull out four people. two are 
doing okay. three are dead and at least three are trapped inside. 
what is needed here is heavy lifting equipment like cranes. a lot 
of the residents are angry that cranes didn't get there in time, didn't 
get there fast enough. one resident told me the first crane that arrived 
was too small. when they tried to lift heavy slabs, they turned right 
over.
