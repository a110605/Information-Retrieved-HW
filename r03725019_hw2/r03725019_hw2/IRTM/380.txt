Ivory Coast's army has pledged its loyalty to opposition candidate 
Loran Gbagbo after violent protests against military ruler Robert 
Guei's claim that he won the presidential election. The army's Chief 
of Staff told television viewers late Wednesday, the military is at 
Mr. Gbagbo's disposal. Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Gbagbo claimed the presidency 
in an address on state run radio. He said he is forming a civilian 
government and thanked Ivorians for rejecting what he calls General 
Guei's electoral coup d'etat.
