The President of Yemen Ali Abdullah Saleh has acknowledged the explosion 
that killed the 17 American sailors in Aden last week was deliberate. 
US authorities insist the blast was a deliberate act but the Yemenis 
initially called it an accident. President Salah now says the security 
forces have preliminary evidence that shows it was a premeditated 
criminal act.
