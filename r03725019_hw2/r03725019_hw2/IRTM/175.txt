The bodies of five sailors killed in an attack on a Navy ship in Yemen 
arrived Friday evening in Germany on their way back to the United 
States. Light rain fell as an Air Force honor guard silently transferred 
the caskets draped in U.S. flags from an Air Force jet into separate 
hearses. Flags at the base in western Germany flew at half staff, 
and sailors in dress blues stood on the tarmac during the ceremony. 
The caskets were being taken to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, 
and were to be transported to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on 
Saturday, said Capt. Todd White, a spokesman at Ramstein. White said 
the bodies of two more sailors recovered so far might arrive on later 
flights carrying some of the wounded. Lt. Cmdr. Daren Pelkie, at the 
Bahrain base of the U.S. Navy 5th Fleet, said more than 30 sailors 
had been flown to Germany for medical attention. They were expected 
to arrive before midnight Friday and be taken to the Landstuhl Regional 
Medical Center, a U.S. military facility. Other injured sailors have 
been taken to the east African country of Djibouti. The United States 
says 17 sailors died and 33 were injured in the explosion on the USS 
Cole while it was refueling in the Yemeni port of Aden. Seven bodies 
have so far been recovered. The blast tore a hole 30 feet high and 
40 feet wide at the ship's waterline. U.S. officials say suicide bombers 
blew up a small boat next to the destroyer.
