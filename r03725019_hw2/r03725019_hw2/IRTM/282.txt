The Yemeni coastline, where the USS Cole met disaster in an apparent 
terrorist bombing last week, is a ``sieve'' for terrorists but was 
the best option available for refueling Navy ships in the volatile 
region, the former U.S. military commander in the region said Thursday. 
Gen. Anthony Zinni, who was commander in chief of U.S. Central Command 
at the time the Pentagon contracted for refueling services in the 
Yemeni port of Aden in December 1998, took responsibility for the 
decision. ``I pass that buck on to nobody,'' Zinni told a Senate Armed 
Services Committee hearing. Zinni, who retired earlier this year, 
said he and the rest of the American government were well aware that 
terrorists use Yemen as a transit route into Saudi Arabia. ``Their 
coast is a sieve,'' he said. Yet there were no better alternatives 
and Navy ships must refuel in that area while moving to and from the 
Persian Gulf, Zinni said. The port of Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa 
and just across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen, had been used but the 
refueling contract there was terminated in about 1997 because the 
facilities were unsatisfactory and ``the threat conditions were far 
worse.'' That left him with ``options that were not very good,'' Zinni 
said. The retired general told the committee that he personally checked 
on the refueling arrangements in a series of visits to Aden between 
May 1998 and May 2000. Each time, Zinni said, it was clear to him 
that the Yemeni government was sincere in wanting American help in 
controlling its coastline. Zinni said his chief of security also visited 
Aden in May 1998 to check on security arrangements. Zinni said Aden 
was one of the few ports in the region where U.S. intelligence had 
not detected specific threats to American interests. The threat conditions 
in Yemen, he said, ``were actually better than we had elsewhere,'' 
including Saudi Arabia.
