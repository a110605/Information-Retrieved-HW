Exhausted searchers using everything from sophisticated rock cutting 
tools to their bare hands, clawed through rubble Sunday hoping to 
find survivors of Western India's massive earthquake and they did 
find some. But more than 6000 bodies have been found since Friday's 
quake centered in Gujarat State and authorities say the death toll 
could reach 20,000. India is calling for massive international aid. 
It has requested a 1.5 billion-dollar disaster loan from the World 
Bank and Asia Development Bank.
