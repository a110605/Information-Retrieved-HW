now to india and the devastating earthquake that officials now believe 
may have killed as many as 20,000. on day three, the search for survivors 
continues, but hopes are fading fast in the quake zone where nbc's 
ron allen is tonight. the grueling, desperate efforts to find survivors 
paid off today. a 40-year-old woman, only her arm visible under the 
rubble since the quake, walked away from the deadly pile of concrete 
and steel. her rescuers believe many more victims are trapped beneath 
the crushed building, but time is fast running out to find anyone 
else alive. there were two other rescues today. an elderly woman and 
man carried away to safety, the extent of their injuries unknown. 
but three days after the massive 7.9 quake hit, they're alive. now, 
help is arriving from around the world. rescue teams hoping they're 
not too late. what we have to do is, to be as quickly as possible 
to the different scenes where we have hope to find people still alive 
and where we can rescue them. however, throughout the vast area of 
devastation, home to 40 million people, there is little good news. 
thousands of families now gather around cremation fires, mourning. 
this morning, the quake zone shook again, a magnitude 6 tremor sent 
people scurrying into the streets. it was the strongest of some 275 
aftershocks. i'm really very much afraid, i'm very afraid. people 
roam the streets, afraid to go back inside damaged homes. many now 
live under tents in the open air. even hospitals are treating patients 
outside. in the hardest-hit town, bhug, more than half the houses 
in a community of 150,000 have been damaged or destroyed. and there 
are still areas the rescue effort have not reached. outlaying towns 
and villages with no communication. the magnitude of the disaster 
here is still unfolding. ron allen, nbc news, india.
