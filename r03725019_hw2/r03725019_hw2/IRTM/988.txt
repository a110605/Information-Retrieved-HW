El Salvador's devastating earthquake _ not deforestation _ was the 
principal cause of a landslide that killed more than 300 people in 
a neighborhood near the capital, officials said Wednesday. The Jan. 
13 earthquake caused a mountainside to collapse, burying the suburban 
neighborhood of Las Colinas. The collapse renewed allegations that 
recent construction had cleared too many trees and made the area vulnerable 
to landslides. Before the magnitude-7.6 quake, environmentalists had 
asked Congress _ and municipal officials had asked the Supreme Court 
_ to block the construction of hillside mansions above Las Colinas. 
Congress didn't respond, the Supreme Court last year denied the petition, 
and construction continued. Several estates, complete with swimming 
pools and gatehouses, were built above the middle-class neighborhood. 
They were also destroyed in the landslide. On Wednesday, officials 
released a report saying there was no evidence that deforestation 
was to blame. However, Public Works Minister Carlos Pollincen said 
more studies were needed. ``As of now, there is nothing that makes 
us think that anything other than the earthquake caused the landslide,'' 
he said. The study was carried out by geologist Edwin Harp and vulcanologist 
James Vallance, members of the U.S. Geological Survey. The two also 
found that other earthquakes or the upcoming rainy season could cause 
more landslides, and they recommended that residents wait to rebuild. 
Officials have prevented more than 20,000 people from returning to 
the area around Las Colinas, saying more landslides are possible. 
The earthquake killed a total of 726 people in El Salvador and six 
others in Guatemala.
