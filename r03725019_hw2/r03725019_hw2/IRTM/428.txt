Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton said Saturday she was ``outraged'' 
that New York Republicans had linked her to the terrorist bombing 
of the USS Cole in phone calls to New York voters. ``I believe the 
Republican Party and Congressman Lazio owe an apology to the families 
of the sailors who died in the terrorist bombing of the USS Cole,'' 
she said. Clinton called the phone calls ``unacceptable,'' adding, 
``Everyone should be condemning it.'' The Oct. 12 blast killed 17 
U.S. sailors and injured 39 others. The state Republican Party refused 
to apologize and said Saturday that the calls would continue. Rep. 
Rick Lazio, Clinton's opponent in the New York Senate race, said New 
York Republicans didn't need ``any instructions or lessons from the 
Arkansas political machine'' surrounding Clinton. ``We don't need 
any advice from (Clinton adviser) Harold Ickes and Hillary Clinton 
on how to run campaigns in New York _ people who are now forced to 
return $50,000 to people who associate themselves with terrorism and 
violence in the Middle East,'' Lazio said. This past week, the Clinton 
campaign returned $50,000 that came from a Boston fund-raiser sponsored 
by a group that supports the Palestinian organization Hamas. The Clinton 
campaign denied knowing the group was involved with the fund-raiser. 
Lazio also charged that Clinton's campaign had hidden a $1,000 donation 
from a Hamas supporter, listing it as coming from the ``American Museum 
Council'' instead the American Muslim Council. The Clinton campaign 
has said the Museum/Muslim discrepancy was a typographical error. 
Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said Saturday that Lazio's charge 
was a smokescreen to cover his role in the GOP phone calls. ``Instead 
of more insults and finger-pointing, he should apologize to the families 
of the murdered sailors and stop the calls,'' Wolfson said. Lazio 
spoke after a rally at a Long Island junior high school. Clinton made 
her comments as she arrived in Ithaca to begin a three-day bus trip 
across upstate New York. Setting her off were newspaper reports Saturday 
that the New York State Republican Committee was calling voters to 
say that Clinton accepted money from an Arab organization that ``openly 
brags about its support for a Mideast terrorism group, the same kind 
of terrorism that killed our sailors on the USS Cole.'' Other calls 
also began going out in recent days to potential Jewish voters in 
which the state Republicans do not mention the USS Cole bombing, but 
do dwell on her dealings with Palestinians and her acceptance of contributions 
from Arab-Americans. A New York 1 News statewide poll out Thursday 
had Clinton leading Lazio, 50 percent to 43 percent. A New York Post/Fox 
5 News poll to be published in Sunday's Post had them in a statistical 
dead heat. The New York Post also planned to publish its endorsement 
of Lazio on Sunday; Clinton was endorsed by The New York Times last 
week. In their final debate, held Friday, the two candidates testily 
hurled charges and repeatedly interrupted each other. ``Order, order! 
The speaker wants order,'' WNBC-TV host Gabe Pressman implored at 
one point. The verbal fireworks began just minutes into the one-hour 
debate when Lazio accused the Clinton administration of governing 
by poll results and the first lady of leaving Arkansas' schools ``at 
the bottom of the barrel.'' After arguing that ``the work we did in 
Arkansas received numerous awards and praise,'' Clinton said, ``I'm 
not here to defend Arkansas. I'm here to run for Senate to represent 
New York.'' ___ On the Net: http://www.hillary2000.org/ http://www.lazio.com/
