From NPR news in Washington, I am Frank Stasio. President Clinton 
today offered comfort to the sailors and the families of the USS Cole. 
He praised the 17 sailors who were killed in an attack on the Cole 
that was docked in a port in Yemen. The President addressed a memorial 
ceremony at Norfolk Naval Air Station. Today we honor our finest young 
people, fallen soldiers who rose to freedoms challenge. We mourn their 
loss, celebrate their lives, and offer the love and prayers of a grateful 
nation to their families. Campaigning today in Wisconsin, George W 
bush also praised the fallen sailors. These young American's lived 
for a cause and died with a purpose. They were patriots and we're 
deeply in their debt. This tragedy is a reminder that peace is always 
fragile, the risk is always real, and hate in this world does not 
sleep. The Navy says the bodies of two more American sailors have 
been recovered from the Cole, the search continues for 4 others believed 
to be still aboard the destroyer. The 2 additional remains will be 
flown to Dover air base in Delaware along with the six bodies recovered 
yesterday.
