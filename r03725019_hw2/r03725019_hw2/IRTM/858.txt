I am David Coler VOA News. In El Salvador authorities buried hundreds 
of bodies in mass graves Monday. One man was found alive after calling 
for help on his cellphone but officials believe thousands of others 
are buried under tons of rocks and mud. The official death toll now 
stands at six hundred but four thousand people are still listed as 
missing. In the town of Komasagua three thousand people were missing 
and feared buried under a massive landslide. Relief worker Steve Matthews 
of the United States says filling basic human needs is priority number 
one. We give them plastic sheeting and cooking utensils and then also 
look after their immediate food needs giving them beans and rice and 
so on. One of the major needs is going to be fresh water, even the 
water pipes in San Salvador have been cracked and broken so fresh 
water is hard to come by. By midday Monday 270 bodies had been retrieved 
from the Las Calenas neighborhood of Santa Tegla, a small town near 
the capital San Salvador.
