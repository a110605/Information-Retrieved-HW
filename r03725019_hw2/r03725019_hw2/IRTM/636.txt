The Clinton administration is prepared to assist Peru's transitional 
government in such areas as counternarcotics enforcement and democratic 
reform before presidential elections set for next April, a senior 
State Department official said Monday. The official, asking not to 
be identified, spoke to reporters five days after the installation 
of interim president Valentin Paniagua, who replaced former President 
Alberto Fujimori. The administration had been highly critical of Fujimori's 
refusal to promote an independent judiciary and other features it 
called essential to a democratic society. The official said Paniagua's 
government must overhaul the electoral machinery with the purpose 
of achieving free, honest and fair elections. Fujimori had resisted 
efforts the Organization of American States initiated last June to 
promote democratic reforms. The official said initial U.S. soundings 
suggest that the Paniagua government will give high priority to the 
counternarcotics struggle. Fujimori, who resigned a week ago in Japan 
amid a corruption scandal, had been an ally of the United States in 
combating drug flow. Estimates say coca cultivation declined 60 percent 
over the past several years under his leadership. The administration 
had been concerned that Fujimori's departure would provoke civil unrest, 
but it is encouraged by what has transpired thus far. Peter Romero, 
who heads the State Department's Latin American affairs bureau and 
visited Lima a week ago as Fujimori was stepping down, said the U.S. 
government ``looks forward to supporting President Paniagua and his 
cabinet as they prepare for new elections and in the process consolidate 
democracy'' He said the cabinet Paniagua has assembled is ``talented 
and respected,'' noting that it is led by former U.N. Secretary General 
Javier Perez de Cuellar. ___ On the Net: State Department Bureau of
