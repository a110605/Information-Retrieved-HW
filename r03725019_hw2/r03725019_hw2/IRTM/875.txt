The State Department announced Tuesday a reward of up to $5 million 
for information that leads to the arrest or conviction of people responsible 
for last October's attack on the USS Cole. Spokesman Richard Boucher 
said information about the reward will be disseminated in Yemen, elsewhere 
in the Middle East and in other areas as needed. The Oct. 12 attack 
on the Cole killed 17 U.S. sailors and wounded 30 others.
