From BBC News in London, I am James Cawling for The World. The Yugoslav 
army has given its support to President elect Vojislav Kostunica. 
Earlier he had an hour long meeting with former President Slobodan 
Milosevic. It's the first meeting since Milosevic was ousted by a 
popular revolt. He conceded defeat and congratulated his successor. 
Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright says, the lifting of international 
sanctions against Serbia can now be discussed. Our sanctions regime 
is not against the people of Serbia, it was against Milosevic. And 
if Milosevic is gone then there are many ways that the sanctions regime 
can be changed and lifted and adjusted. Albright says Milosevic must 
not be allowed to maintain any position of power. Earlier Russia also 
recognized Kostunica as Yugoslavia's new leader. Visiting foreign 
minister Evan Holf told Milosevic his time is up.
