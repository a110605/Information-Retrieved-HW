thanks for joining us. here's our top story -- the pentagon says it 
believes the explosion that damaged the u.s. navy destroyer "cole" 
was a suicide terrorist attack by two men in a small boat. it happened 
today as the 505-foot long ship was docked for refueling in the port 
of aden, yemen. the pentagon says the small boat pulled alongside 
the "cole" and the two men on board stood at attention as the boat 
exploded. four sailors were killed, 35 were injured, and as many as 
a dozen are missing. the navy has flown medical personnel from bahrain 
to aden to help care for the wounded. fbi agents are en route to the 
scene to gather evidence. this is file video of the ship you're seeing 
right now. the explosion blew a 20-to-40-foot hole on the port side 
of the ship's hull. flooding has been contained on board, but the 
destroyer is listing four degrees. all other ships of the fifth fleet 
have been ordered out to sea and placed on a higher state of alert. 
president clinton told a gathering today he is taking steps for those 
responsible for the attack on the "uss cole." if, as it now appears 
this was an act of terrorism, it was a despicable and cowardly act. 
we will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable. if 
their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace 
and security in the middle east, they will fail utterly. the families 
of the victims are being notified.
