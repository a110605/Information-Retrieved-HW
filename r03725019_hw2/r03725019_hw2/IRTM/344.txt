The government in Ivory Coast has delayed announcing results from 
Sunday's Presidential election until later today. On Monday, soldiers 
in Abidjan, fired teargas at opposition demonstrators who tried to 
force their way into the National Electoral Commission building where 
votes were being counted. The VOA correspondent in Abidjan, says demonstrators 
support opposition socialist candidate Laurent Gbagbo. Early returns 
on Monday, showed Mr. Baghbel with a slight lead over military ruler 
General Robert Guei. The election is intended to restore civilian 
rule to Ivory Coast following a military coup in December.
