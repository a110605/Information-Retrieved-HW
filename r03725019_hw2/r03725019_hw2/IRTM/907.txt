Serena Williams, eager to get out of the heat, beat Tamarine Tanasugarn 
6-1, 6-4 in 58 minutes Saturday in the Australian Open. Top-seeded 
Martina Hingis joined Williams in the fourth round 18 minutes later, 
beating wild card Virginie Razzano on an adjacent court 7-5, 6-1. 
With a summer heat wave in its second day, temperatures were in the 
90s and soared to 125 on the sunbaked hardcourts. A sizzling court 
prompted chair umpire Jane Harvey to allow a brief interruption in 
the middle of a game during the Hingis-Razzano match. ``Ladies and 
gentlemen, there'll be a short break while Miss Razzano changes her 
shoes,'' Harvey announced. Hingis decided to change shoes too. Also 
advancing was 13th-seeded Amelie Mauresmo, the 1999 runner-up. She 
beat former French Open champion Iva Majoli 6-4, 6-2. Unseeded Rita 
Grande beat Australian Evie Dominikovic 6-3, 6-4. Two Frenchmen advanced. 
No. 15 Arnaud Clement beat Roger Federer 7-6 (5), 6-4, 6-4, and No. 
16 Sebastien Grosjean beat Thomas Johansson 6-4, 6-1, 6-4. Serena 
Williams, seeded sixth, lost her serve three times but was the much 
more aggressive player, belting 16 winners to four for Tanasugarn. 
Williams is one round from a possible quarterfinal matchup against 
top-seeded Martina Hingis. Hingis fell behind 4-2 but rallied to take 
the opening set in 39 minutes _ about the length of her first two 
matches. She then pulled away, with half her points coming on errors 
by the 17-year-old Razzano. Mauresmo was 0-for-5 on break-point opportunities 
before Majoli dumped a backhand into the net to lose the first set. 
Mauresmo broke again for a 2-0 lead in the second set, never lost 
serve and closed out the win in 1 hour, 16 minutes. The Frenchwoman 
has yet to drop a set in three rounds. Mauresmo, who was unseeded 
when she lost the 1999 final to Hingis, has struggled with a lower 
back injury since last spring. She was ranked sixth a year ago but 
has slipped to 20th.
