thanks for joining us. good afternoon. our top story -- investigators 
are looking for new clues on land and at sea. eight days after the 
apparent terrorist bombing of the "uss cole." a senior official says 
divers in yemen are retrieving evidence from the sea floor and from 
damaged areas on the destroyer. but he adds the process is moving 
slowly. authorities believe two suicide bombers pulled alongside the 
"cole" in a small boat and blew it up. yemeni officials say they found 
bomb-making materials at an apartment believed to be rented by the 
two men. these are the first pictures we have of that apartment. witnesses 
being questioned include a welding shop owner who worked for the suspects, 
the apartment landlord, and a real estate agent who found the apartment. 
fbi director louis freeh says it's too early to speculate whether 
the men are linked to saudi dissident osama bin laden. the u.s. accuses 
bin laden of masterminding the 1998 bombings of its embassies in kenya 
and tanzania.
