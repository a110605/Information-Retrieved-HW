In the Barent sea, divers recovered more bodies, Sunday from the undersea 
wreckage of the Russian submarine Kursk. All 118 seamen on the sub 
were killed after it was shattered by two explosions and crashed to 
the sea floor, last August. As the recovery work proceeded, a memorial 
ceremony for the Kursk crew was held Sunday in a Russian military 
seaport.
