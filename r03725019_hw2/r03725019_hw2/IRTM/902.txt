US Defense Secretary William Cohen says he and top US military commanders 
failed to anticipate threats to the US destroyer Cole in Yemen three 
months ago. A Navy report on the suicide bombing released today faults 
the USS Cole's Captain for failing to take certain security measures 
on entering the Yemeni port of Aden. Mr. Cohen says the Pentagon's 
entire chain of command should have been more imaginative and creative 
in anticipating the kinds of threats facing US forces around the world. 
Clever, committed terrorists are predators who will always search 
and look for weaknesses and we simply have to do a better job of finding 
and correcting those weaknesses before the terrorists find them and 
exploit them. The Navy report does not recommend any disciplinary 
action against the ship's skipper or any other individual.
