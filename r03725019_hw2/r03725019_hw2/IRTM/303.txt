The US navy has issued a revised timetable of events leading to last 
week's deadly bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in the Yemeni port 
of Aden. VOA Pentagon correspondent Alex Belida reports, the new timeline 
raises new questions about how the apparent terrorist attack was carried 
out. The navy now says the blast occurred nearly two hours after the 
destroyer had moored for refueling in Aden Harbor, not during the 
mooring operation itself. Originally navy officials said a small boat 
that assisted in securing the ship's lines or whose movements were 
masked by the mooring operation pulled aside the Cole and blew-up 
in an apparent suicide attack. A navy spokesman, Commander Greg Smith 
offers no new explanation of the circumstances leading to the blast, 
saying that is now a matter for criminal investigators. However, Commander 
Smith says, the navy remains firm in its assessment that the explosion 
was the result of a terrorist attack and not a refueling accident, 
even though the new time table confirms refueling was underway. That 
raises questions about how a single boat could have approached without 
raising the suspicions of armed guards posted as part of the heightened 
alert status required for the Cole's port visit. Alex Belida, VOA
