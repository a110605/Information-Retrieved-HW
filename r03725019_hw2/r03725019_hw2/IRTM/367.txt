hello from atlanta. our top story this half hour, the man responsible 
for u.s. forces in the persian gulf says there was no specific threat 
of an imminent attack in the yemeni port of aden before a bomb ripped 
into the "uss cole" there this month. army general tommy franks, head 
of the u.s. central command, today testified before the senate armed 
services committee to answer questions about the attack. he told lawmakers 
it would not trigger a u.s. retreat from the persian gulf, even though 
troops remain at risk to terrorism. 17 sailors were killed and dozens 
were injured when the explosion blew a huge hole into the hull of 
the navy destroyer as it was refueling in aden. franks said u.s. war 
ships have made almost 30 safe visits to aden since january of last 
year. he added the attack is already the subject of an intense investigation 
by many agencies. we're determined to get to the bottom of this. we'll 
put the events that led up to "cole" under a microscope. and, in fact, 
we've begun that process. we will find the facts we need to find, 
and we'll use the lessons that we learn from "cole" to provide the 
best possible force protection for our troops in one of the most dangerous 
regions of the world.
