A Pentagon report called Tuesday for improved intelligence gathering 
to prevent terrorist attacks like the one in Yemen last October against 
the US destroyer Cole. The report also urged each of the military 
services to give regional commanders full time specialists in anti-terrorism. 
The report was commissioned by Defense Secretary William Cohen. We 
have focused we have done a great job in terms of force protection 
during the last four years in improving it. We have not done as good 
a job in terms of so called intransit force protection. And if we're 
going to continue our engagement policy and send our ships into areas 
that do pose risk to our sailors, then we're on fixed installations 
that we got to take more pro-active measures, not simply act out of 
a defense oriented mentality but to take a much more aggressive stance. 
Secretary Cohen said the report's major conclusion is that terrorists 
must be viewed as relentless enemies.
