we have the first pictures today from the navy of the "uss cole"'s 
deck the day after the attack in october. sailors resting because 
they have nowhere else to sleep, many stricken or hurt. 17 of their 
shipmates were killed, and though we've seen the hole caused by the 
bomb from various angles before, one gets another sense here from 
this picture of how powerful a charge the suicide bombers set off.
