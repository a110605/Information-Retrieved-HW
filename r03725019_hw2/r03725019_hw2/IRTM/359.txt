The Pentagon has confirmed that US forces in the Gulf have gone on 
to the highest alert status following information about a possible 
attack. Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral Craig Quigley says the move 
is based on intelligence of specific threats to bases in Qatar and 
Bahrain. He says the credibility of the threats can't be assessed 
but the forces must be on their guard. Given the circumstances, the 
recent attack on the Cole and the generally higher level of threat 
throughout that region, we thought it was simply the prudent thing 
to do to go to that higher threat condition in those two specific 
areas. About a thousand US personnel are in Bahrain, mainly from the 
Fifth Fleet, fewer than fifty are in Qatar looking after pre-positioned 
equipment there. The highest alert status is also still in effect 
in Yemen where investigations continue into the attack on the USS 
Cole.
