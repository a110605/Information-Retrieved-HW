First, an update of world news with Rebecca Ward. Thank you Tony. 
India's Defense Minister says as many as 100,000 people may have died 
in the earthquake that struck Gujarat State Friday. In an interview 
late Monday with the BBC, George Fernandez says another 200,000 people 
were injured. There is little hope of finding any more survivors in 
the rubble. Rescue worker Sanjay Sejwal says a five year old boy was 
one of the lucky ones on Monday. They dug a hole and gave him water 
to drink and kept him alive. And the boy's still suffering from trauma 
because he keeps saying even though he's rescued and he has bad bruises 
all over his face and body, he keeps saying "Save me, get me out of 
here". The focus in Gujarat has now shifted from rescue to relief 
for people who have no food or shelter. The Indian government has 
sent special trains and a ship to Gujarat with medical workers and 
relief supplies.
