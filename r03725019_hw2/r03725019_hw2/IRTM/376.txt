Ivory Coast's army has pledged its loyalty to opposition candidate 
Loran Gbagbo. The pledge followed a tumultuous 24 hours that ended 
the rule of the Hunta, which seized power last December. Soldiers 
and civilians took to the streets to celebrate the departure of Hunta 
leader General Robert Guei. In an address on state television, Wednesday, 
Mr. Gbagbo, leader of the Ivorian Socialist party said he would be 
forming a cabinet shortly.
