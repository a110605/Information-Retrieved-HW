now to the news in the rest of the world. things are changing very 
quickly for yugoslavia. it was only thursday we were watching the 
revolution there unfold. today the european union said it's dropping 
its oil embargo, and its travel restrictions to serbia. and shiela 
m vicar reports from belgrade tonight, some of milosevic's the supporters 
probably wish they were elsewhere today. the revolution came to belgrade's 
intercontinental hotel this morning. the staff decided they had had 
enough of their boss, a milosevic crony who the hotel staff believe 
is also a thief, who skimmed profits for the regime. chanting "who 
stole our money?" they wanted to know. and in the end, they demanded, 
and got his resignation. cheering change is taking place very fast 
here. tonight, a group of extreme nationalists, so powerful until 
last thursday, was attacked by a crowd. and even when it was clear 
they had lots of guns, the people didn't back off. at a factory seized 
by the regime two years ago, the workers welcomed back the american 
owner. everywhere, it seems, the milosevic empire is crumbling. are 
they finished, do you think? they are done. you are sure? i am positive. 
even in milosevic's hometown, his son's cybercafe has been trashed. 
and at his son's theme park, deserted. the new government is offering 
slobodan milosevic two choices. stay in belgrade and face charges 
of election fraud and corruption here, or flee the country, and risk 
arrest as an indicted war criminal. for now, slobodan milosevic is 
still believed to be holed up in his residence in belgrade. sheila 
m vicar, abc news, belgrade. overseas today, two areas of the world 
where the united states has vital interests, one looking better, and 
one looking worse.
