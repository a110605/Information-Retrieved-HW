a russian navy spokesman says bad weather could complicate the work 
to recover bodies from the sunken nuclear submarine "kursk." russian 
and norwegian divers successfully removed a rubber coating between 
the inner and outer hulls of sub yesterday. thick fog, rain and high 
winds are limiting visibility at the site. all 118 people on board 
the "kursk" died when the submarine exploded and sank to the bottom 
of the barents sea.
