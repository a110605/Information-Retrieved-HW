A Russian scientist has told the Moscow City Court that the information 
an American businessman allegedly tried to purchase about a Russian 
torpedo is commonly available and not a state secret. Arseni Mianded, 
an expert on the torpedo and a defense witness at the trial of businessman 
Edmund Pope, said he had often used the torpedo information for his 
research and had spoken openly about it. Defense lawyer Parvail Oskinoff 
said the testimony would help his client. In the past, Mr. Oskinoff 
has been very skeptical of Mr. Pope's chances of getting a fair trial.
