Embattled Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has lost control of 
Congress for the first time in eight years amid rumors he may seek 
political asylum abroad. As his control of Peru crumbled, President 
Fujimori left for Japan Thursday, following an Asia-Pacific summit 
in Brunei. Officials say he will attend a summit of Latin American 
leaders in Panama this weekend, but there is widespread speculation 
that he will not return to Peru.
