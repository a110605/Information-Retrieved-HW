A note scribbled by an officer on the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk 
has revealed that at least 23 of its 118 crewmembers survived the 
explosions which sank the vessel. The note was found in the pocket 
of Lieutenant Dimitri Kolesnikov whose body was one of the first to 
be recovered the explosions that shattered the submarine. Most of 
the Kursk's crew apparently died instantly in the explosions that 
tore open the Kursk's first six compartments or within minutes as 
water roared into the submarine. Lieutenant Kolesnikov's note indicates 
some crewmembers survived for several hours.
