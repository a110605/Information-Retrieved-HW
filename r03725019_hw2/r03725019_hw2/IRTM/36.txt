strikes and protests against serb president slobodan milosevic appear 
to be intensifying in yugoslavia. thousands of protesters gathered 
in the central part of belgrade today and marched to the city court. 
they hope to submit a petition charging milosevic with criminal offenses. 
earlier, opposition leaders launched a formal complaint alleging vote 
tampering in last month's presidential election. serb police have 
moved in on a coal mine in an effort to get striking miners to restart 
production. the miners have cut coal supplies to the state-owned electric 
utility. that has caused the utility to impose rolling blackouts across 
serbia.
