President Elect George W Bush has nominated outgoing Missouri Senator, 
John Ashcroft to be Attorney General. At a news conference Friday 
morning in Austin Texas, Mr. Bush said Mr. Ashcroft would strive to 
be a guardian of liberty and equal justice. He's a man who'll uphold 
the law. He stands on principle and he will not politicize the Attorney 
General's office. Mr. Ashcroft was defeated in his US Senate re-election 
bid last month by the late Governor Mel Carnahand, whose widow Jean 
was appointed to his seat. In other appointments Mr. Bush named New 
Jersey Governor Christie Whitman as his choice to head the Environmental 
Protection Agency. Ms. Whitman said she is eager to take the new job. 
For the past seven years I have what I believe to have been the best 
job in America, Governor of New Jersey. I also believe that my job 
has given me the best preparation for this new opportunity, an opportunity 
that I embrace with great enthusiasm and great expectation. Mr. Bush 
also selected Virginia Governor, James Gilmore to be the Chairman 
of the Republican National Committee.
