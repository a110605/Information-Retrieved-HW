A massive international relief effort continues in India to help hundreds 
of thousands left injured, hungry and homeless by last week's earthquake. 
Volunteers and supplies have been pouring into the once prosperous 
state of Gujarat, which was ravaged by the January 26 quake. However, 
a lack of coordination is hampering the entire operation with distribution 
still a problem. The confirmed death toll is over 25,000 but Defense 
Minister George Fernandes says the death toll could reach one hundred 
thousand. Rescue crews continue checking the rubble hoping to find 
more survivors. Authorities have stepped up security in response to 
reports of looting and food riots.
