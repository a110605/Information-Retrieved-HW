thank you for looking in. here's our top story this half hour -- the 
42 day manhunt for seven texas prison escapees concluded early today 
when the last two fugitives surrendered. police cornered the wanted 
men in a colorado springs hotel room. the convicts surrendered peacefully 
after a six-hour standoff. shortly before they gave themselves up, 
authorities allowed the fugitives, patrick murphy and donald newbury, 
to speak by phone with local tv news anchor, eric singer. in their 
interviews, the men complained about the texas criminal justice system. 
our judicial system in the state of texas has really gone to the pits. 
we're receiving 99 years for a robbery, for $68. nobody's injured. 
there was no proof that the gun was used in the robbery other than 
an unreliable witness that picked out several and everything before. 
it was created a statement through information of my priors and everything 
else that apparently the prosecutor had given to him, which was apparently 
against the law as well. we have a texas ranger, he admitted in trial 
that the evidence was tainted, yet, i received 99 years. the deal 
is you have five minutes of peace to be able to talk. and i wasn't 
going to in any way take that time from him to somehow make the situation 
even worse. so i continued to come up with different questions that 
would steer them in a general direction so they wouldn't relive any 
kind of violent situations. they wouldn't relive what they remembered 
that could perhaps set the whole tone of the negotiations in a negative 
way. on monday, authorities arrested fugitives george rivas, michael 
rodriguez and joseph garcia, at a woodland park, colorado, convenience 
store. randy halprin surrendered to authorities at the motor home 
where the convicts had been living. and fugitive larry harper shot 
himself to death inside the home.
