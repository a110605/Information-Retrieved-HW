Well Dave, tens of thousands of Serbs have taken to the streets and 
towns and cities throughout Yugoslavia to celebrate as President-elect 
Vojislav Kostunica prepares to take office. Mr. Kostunica will be 
sworn in, could be sworn in rather, as early as today. President Clinton 
has called Yugoslavia's popular uprising against Slobodan Milosevic 
an extraordinary victory for the Serbian people. He pledged Friday 
that the United States and its allies would work together to lift 
sanctions to bring Yugoslavia out of isolation. The European Community 
wants to lift sanctions as early as Monday. Most world leaders have 
welcomed the ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic.
