As the manhunt continues for seven prison escapees wanted in a police 
officer's death, authorities are looking into possible security lapses 
that may have set the stage for the prison break. Mac Stringfellow, 
chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice, says lapses by prison 
guards may be to blame for the escape at the medium-security Connally 
Unit. ``Obviously, policies and procedures were not followed,'' Stringfellow 
told the San Antonio Express-News for Monday editions. ``If those 
procedures are followed, an escape cannot occur, but when you get 
lax, get complacent, this is what can result.'' Stringfellow made 
the remarks as the board prepared to meet Thursday. The Texas Department 
of Criminal Justice was scheduled to present a report on the escape 
at the meeting. ``The problem at the Connally Unit I certainly don't 
believe is systemic,'' Stringfellow said, ``but prudence requires 
that we take a look at the operation in all our prisons.'' In the 
escape, the inmates took 14 revolvers, a shotgun, a rifle and more 
than 200 rounds of ammunition after overpowering guards. They later 
amassed dozens more weapons in a sporting goods store robbery on Christmas 
Eve, during which Irving police officer Aubrey Hawkins was shot to 
death. As authorities try to determine the cause of the escape, police 
and prison officials hope a $200,000 reward will help them recapture 
the seven fugitives. ``We hope the high reward money will entice those 
people who have been assisting them in traveling and hiding,'' prison 
spokesman Larry Todd said. ``We believe these are the same people 
who helped them make good on the escape.'' The fugitives _ two convicted 
murderers, two armed robbers, a child beater, a serial rapist and 
a burglar _ have been on the run since Dec. 13. Authorities believe 
the group is hiding out in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The reward 
doubled Saturday when $100,000 was offered by Bond Jumper, an online 
company that seeks to help capture people who fail to appear in court 
after being charged with a crime. There's also a possibility that 
one of the seven escapees might break ranks and offer to help the 
authorities to avoid the death penalty, said Tory Caeti, a criminology 
professor at the University of North Texas. But he said that could 
be a risky proposition. ``Anybody in this group who shows they are 
breaking away is in trouble,'' Caeti said. A Saturday night broadcast 
of the crime TV show ``America's Most Wanted,'' featuring a story 
on the escapees along with a toll-free number for sightings, yielded 
132 tips. Authorities were working to follow up on those calls, Todd 
said. ___ On the Net: Irving Police Department: http://www.irvingpd.com/
