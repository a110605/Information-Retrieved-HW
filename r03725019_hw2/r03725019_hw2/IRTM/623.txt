One of the suicide bombers believed to have carried out last month's 
attack on the USS Cole is linked to the 1998 bombings of the U.S. 
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, a Yemeni source close to the investigation 
said Thursday. The connection was made after a composite sketch of 
one of the two suspected suicide bombers appeared to match that of 
a man wanted for questioning in connection with the bombings of the 
embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the source 
said. The bombings killed 224 people. A senior U.S. law enforcement 
official in the United States declined to comment on the reported 
resemblance, but did say that since the beginning of the Cole investigation 
there have been a number of threads that appear to link the Cole case 
to the earlier bombings in East Africa. After months of careful planning, 
two suicide bombers on Oct. 12 brought a small boat laden with explosives 
alongside the Cole and detonated it while the ship was refueling in 
the Yemeni port of Aden. The explosion killed 17 U.S. sailors and 
injured 39. Over the past couple of days, U.S. investigators in Aden 
have attended some of the interrogations of the six main suspects, 
said the Yemeni source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The United 
States is pressing Yemeni authorities to allow U.S. agents a greater 
role in the investigation. They have already been allowed to question 
eyewitnesses. Investigators have focused on Muslim extremists angered 
by the U.S. military presence in the Arabian Peninsula, especially 
Saudi Arabia. U.S. investigators have said the attack bears the earmarks 
of followers of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire and 
Afghanistan war veteran whom officials say ordered the East Africa 
bombings.
