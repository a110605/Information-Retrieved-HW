I am Dave Deforest, VOA News. International rescue teams are heading 
to India to help search for victims of an earthquake that has killed 
as many as 13,000 people. Britain has pledged four and a half million 
dollars and is sending a military plane with 69 rescue workers. Russia 
is sending at least 59 medical and rescue specialists to the region. 
In addition offers of help are coming from other countries including 
the United States. Indian officials say the bodies of 2500 people 
have been recovered so far.
