good evening. it starred at 7:00 a.m. when the phone rang at the president's 
upstate new york home. it was his national security advisor with news 
that a u.s. warship, the destroyer u.s.s. cole, had been the target 
of an apparent and massive terrorist bomb. it was more bad news from 
a region of the world already on the brink of a huge conflict. in 
israel today, there was live firing after at least two israeli soldiers 
were killed. israelis struck back after giving three hours notice. 
targets were destroyed, including yasser arafat's headquarters. all 
of this combined with some negative corporate news to send the markets 
down, way down, the fifth largest point loss for the dow ever. the 
nasdaq closing at its lowest point level of the year. we have coverage 
of all of of this tonight from tel aviv to washington to wall street.
