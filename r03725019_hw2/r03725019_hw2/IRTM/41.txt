The Constitutional Court in Yugoslavia has reportedly annulled part 
of last month's controversial presidential election. Opposition leaders 
say the ruling means the vote is now null and void but they say they 
will continue their protest to force President Slobadon Milosevic 
from power. Paul Wood reports. The man the Opposition say is the true 
winner of the election, Vojislov Coustunitza, says he believes this 
decision by the Constitutional Court is a trick designed to divide 
the Opposition and take the momentum out of their protest, which is 
daily gathering force. The Opposition campaign manager, Zoran Djindjic 
says the ruling amounts to a cancellation of the whole election, with 
no date set for a re-run. If so, these appear to be classic delaying 
tactics by Mr. Milosevic, who has in the past proved himself a master 
tactician and who may this time be trying to set a trap for the Opposition.
