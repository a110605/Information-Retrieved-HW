also at the white house tonight, president bush has put vice president 
dick cheney in charge of a federal energy policy task force that will, 
among other things, try to deal with california's power crisis. bush 
said a priority will be increasing domestic oil and gas production, 
including opening the arctic wildlife refuge in alaska to oil drilling. 
the president said he will not try to revoke former president clinton's 
pardon of marc rich, saying he wouldn't try to undo presidential prerogatives. 
it also turns out lewis libby also once represented rich and also 
tried to arrange a pardon for him during that time.
