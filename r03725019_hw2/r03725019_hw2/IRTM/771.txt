the reward has been doubled for information leading to the arrest 
and conviction of seven fugitives on the run from a texas prison. 
officials hope the now-$200,000 reward will entice anyone helping 
the escapees to turn them in for the money. last night's airing of 
"america's most wanted," featuring a story on the fugitives, brought 
in nearly 100 new tips in two hours. in all, some 1,200 tips have 
been reported since the group escaped last month.
