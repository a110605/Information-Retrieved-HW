norwegian divers are taking advantage of better weather to resume 
recovery efforts at the site where the russian submarine the "kursk" 
sank. they're cutting through a thick rubber cover and the outer hull 
today. weather permitting, they hope to cut through the inner hull 
tomorrow and gain access to the sub. 118 people were killed when two 
explosions sank the "kursk." four bodies have been recovered so far.
