Salvadoran authorities are warning of possible epidemics in the wake 
of last Saturday's devastating earthquake that killed more than 680 
people and left some 54,000 homeless. Public health officials are 
reporting an increase in cases of diarrhea and respiratory infections 
reported among survivors of the quake.
