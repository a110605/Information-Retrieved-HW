In a rare humanitarian act between longtime rivals, a Pakistani air 
force plane was to carry relief material Tuesday to victims of India's 
devastating earthquake. Pakistani officials said a C-130 transport 
plane would leave Rawalpindi with about 13 tons of relief goods consisting 
of 200 tents and 2,500 blankets. Two more relief planes will be sent 
in the next couple of days, the officials said on condition of anonymity. 
The first plane was to land in Ahmedabad, the commercial capital of 
India' Gujarat state, which was the region hardest hit by the earthquake. 
India was struck by a 7.9-magnitude quake Friday that killed thousands. 
The logistics of the aid were worked out between Vijay Nambiar, the 
Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan, and Jehangir Ashraf Qazi, his 
counterpart in New Delhi. Pakistan offered help to India soon after 
the earthquake, but said Monday that India had turned down the offer. 
India denied this, saying New Delhi was willing to accept aid from 
any country. The two countries have fought three wars since the creation 
of Pakistan in 1947 after the partition of British colonial India.
