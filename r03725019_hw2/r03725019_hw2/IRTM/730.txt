A police officer was shot and killed as he responded to a robbery 
at a sporting goods store that had just closed on Christmas Eve, authorities 
said. Several employees were in the store at the time, but no one 
was injured, police said. No customers were in the store. About 30 
minutes after the Oshman's store closed Sunday, police got a call 
about a robbery in progress there, police spokesman Lt. David Tull 
said. Three officers responded to the call. One of the officers was 
shot when he confronted three men at the back of the store. Police 
identified the officer as 29-year-old Aubry Hawkins, who had been 
with the department since October 1999. Police said the robbers fled 
after herding the employees into a corner of the store. Late Sunday 
night, police questioned the employees at police headquarters. Lou 
Morris, whose son Andrew is a cashier at the store, said she arrived 
at the store at 8 p.m. to find crime tape and police cars around the 
building. ``I talked to Andrew earlier in the day, and he said he'd 
be home about 6:30. When it got to be 7 or 7:30 I started to get worried,'' 
she told the Dallas Morning News. Police were looking for three men 
seen leaving in a 1996 white Ford Explorer that was stolen from a 
store employee.
