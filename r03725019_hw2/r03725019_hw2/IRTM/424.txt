The situation in Ivory Coast remains tense one week after a controversial 
presidential election that led to mass unrest and the ouster of the 
country's military ruler. A curfew remains in effect with authorities 
vowing to track down and punish killers of about 50 young men found 
in a mass grave Friday outside Abidjan.
