From NPR news in Washington, I am Corey Flintoff. FBI investigators 
are on the scene in the Yemeni port of Aden where yesterday's attack 
on a US navy destroyer left at least 7 sailors dead, 10 missing, and 
33 injured. Defence Secretary William Cohen said this evening that 
Pentagon officials are now operating on the assumption that the missing 
sailors will not be found alive. A navy spokesman in Bahrain said 
about 30 injured sailors from the USS Cole had been flown to US military 
hospitals in Germany, 3 sailors had been taken to a closer French 
military hospital in Djibouti, West Africa. As investigators looked 
for clues to the explosion that crippled the Cole, another explosion 
in Yemen damaged the British embassy this morning. NPR's Julie McCarthy 
reports from London. Pro-Palestinian rallies have been held daily 
in Yemen, now the site of 2 attacks in less than 24 hours. US navy 
officials who have examined the hole of the damaged destroyer USS 
Cole have determined that the blast came from an external source, 
bolstering the conclusion the explosion was a deliberate act. Britain 
says the blast in its Yemeni Embassy was the work of terrorists. A 
powerful explosion damaged the compound's perimeter wall and shattered 
windows. No one was injured. Events in the Middle East dominate the 
European Union's informal summit today. Its agenda of internal reforms 
has been eclipsed as Europe, like the US, scrambles for ways to end 
the orgy of violence that has derailed the talk of peace. Fears of 
spiraling unrest have suppressed Europe's markets. Julie McCarthy,
