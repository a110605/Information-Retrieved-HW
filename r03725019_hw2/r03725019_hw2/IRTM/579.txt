the current president concluded a historic visit to vietnam today. 
his final stop? the city formerly known as saigon, scene of a mass 
u.s. evacuation 25 years ago, when this country decided to withdraw 
from vietnam. nbc's fred francis is traveling with the president. 
no one works a crowd like william jefferson clinton. it does not matter 
that this is vietnam. he loved it, and the people here seemed to love 
him, if only because the americans were back, briefly. that is not 
to say the communist government was overjoyed with his visit. thousands 
of people were chased off the streets for his midnight arrival. "the 
government," said one vietnamese, "did not want to be embarrassed 
by an american president sparking such enthusiasm." you should be 
very praddo oh in his first speech of the day, the president took 
a poke at the old-style leaders here, saying the rewards of a free 
market economy "should be embraced, not feared." the years of animosity 
are past. today, we have a shared interest in your well-being and 
prosperity. we have a stake in your future and wish to be your partners. 
but silent partners if the communists have their way. in fact, they 
did little in advance publicity for this historic visit. the little 
official blurb that i saw in the english-language vietnamese newspaper 
on the way over, was a one-inch -- one column, one inch saying that 
mr. clinton and his wife will be here. for the vast majority of vietnamese, 
mr. clinton's visit is little more than a curiosity. but here in the 
south, in the former saigon, they sense that it's something special. 
here, the u.s. is still number one. fred francis, nbc news, ho chi 
minh city.
