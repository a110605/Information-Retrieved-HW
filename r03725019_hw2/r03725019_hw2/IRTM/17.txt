Serbia remains tense today in the wake of a massive civil disobedience 
campaign begun Monday to force President Slobodan Milosevic to concede 
election defeat. In nearly every Serbian city protestors marched in 
the streets demanding Mr. Milosevic recognize opposition candidate 
Vojislav Kostunica as the outright winner of last week's presidential 
election. Banks, coal mines and other institutions shut down as workers 
protested a second runoff election scheduled for this Sunday. Mr. 
Milosevic accuses his opponents of using blackmail and bribery to 
organize the work stoppages that have brought much of Serbia to a 
standstill. At a news conference in Belgrade, the President said Yugoslavia 
would face foreign occupation if Mr. Kostunica came to power. The 
Clinton administration is clear on its view on the Milosevic move. 
White House Spokesman Jake Sewart. He belongs out of power, out of 
Serbia and at the International Tribunal. We will do everything we 
can to make sure that he makes his court date there.
