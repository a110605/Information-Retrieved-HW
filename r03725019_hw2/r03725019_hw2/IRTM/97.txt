here's the latest on our top story today -- it's a day of celebration 
in yugoslavia as the country prepares to welcome a new president. 
an official swearing-in ceremony for vojislav kostunica should be 
held later today in the capital city of belgrade. alessio vinci says 
the event was scheduled to take place hours ago but has been delayed 
because of a prolonged meeting of the newly elected yugoslav parliament. 
this point we understand the two chambers are meeting separately because 
the mandates of all the deputies must be checked out and confronted. 
at this point we understand that there are some problems with some 
deputies in the upper house of the federal parliament. there are some 
votes that apparently were counted wrong. any way, it's unclear exactly 
what's happening. but they are contesting some seats. in that case 
f the two chamber cannot agree and meet here, kostunica until then 
will not be able to take his hold. outgoing president slobodan milosevic 
had refused to concede defeat in last month's presidential election 
until yesterday. independent observers had declared kostunica the 
winner, but milosevic had disputed the result, calling for a run-off. 
that spurred widespread protests and prompted thousands of yugoslavians 
to descend on belgrade. the demonstrators were met with tear gas thursday 
as they stormed the parliament building. the protesters also took 
control of the building containing the state-run television network. 
in a televised address yesterday, milosevic congratulated kostunica 
on his victory and said he will take a break before returning to political 
life. cnn has learned milosevic's son, daughter-in-law and grandson 
left the country this morning. the president of the yugoslav pilots' 
union says they flew to moscow carrying only a few pieces of luggage.
