a rare outcome in missouri puts the widow of the late democratic governor 
mel carnahan in the u.s. senate. carnahan was elected to the senate, 
beating republican incumbent john ashcroft. he died three weeks ago 
in a plane crash. jean carnahan has said she will accept the new governor's 
appointment to the job. no one has ever been posthumously elected 
to the senate, though deceased candidates were elected to the house 
on at least three occasions.
