In Ivory Coast, the government has delayed releasing results of Sunday's 
Presidential election. As Luis Ramirez reports from Abidjan. Supporters 
of the main opposition leaders staged a number of street demonstrations. 
Supporters of Socialist Laurent Gbagbo, the only major candidate allowed 
to run against military ruler General Robert Guei took to the street 
on Monday driving around Abidjan in caravans honking horns and demanding 
that the government release election results quickly. Early return 
showed Mr. Baboa ahead of General Gay in the elections, which are 
intended to restore civilian rule to the West African country, following 
its first coup last December. More than a full day after the polls 
closed, the National Election Commission had still not announced the 
final results. The electoral commission closed the doors of the building 
in Abidjan where the votes are being tallied, evicting journalists 
and others for several hours on Monday. Soldiers fired teargas at 
a group of Baboa supporters who tried to approach the building during 
the closure. The crowd was quickly dispersed. In Abidjan's plateau 
business districts, several streets remained closed off with barbed 
wire barricades and soldiers armed, patrol across the city. Luis Ramirez,
