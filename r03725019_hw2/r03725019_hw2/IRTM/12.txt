Yugoslav opposition leaders sharply criticized both the United States 
and Russia today as a general strike against President Slobodan Milosevic 
gained momentum across the country. NPR's Sylvia Pajoli reports from 
Podgorica. With the international community anxiously following the 
Yugoslav political crisis from the sidelines Kostunica accused the 
Russian government of indecision and said Washington was indirectly 
helping Milosevic's cause. He was scheming with the United States, 
which he said never missed a chance to mention that there's an indictment 
against Milosevic at the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague as if this 
were more important Kostunica added than the fate of a nation. And 
still Russia which has offered to mediate but thus far has not joined 
western governments in embracing Kostunica as the victor against Milosevic, 
the opposition leader was very critical. He said Russian policy has 
been indecisive and reluctant and he described it as one step forward 
and one back. Sylvia Pajoli , NPR News, Podgorica
