the u.s. navy is revising the timeline of last week's attack on the 
"uss cole." it says the explosion happened more than two hours after 
the ship was tied to a fuel dock, not during the mooring operation, 
as previously thought. some wonder then, how the terrorists' boat 
could have escaped notice, since there should have been no other boats 
near the "cole." the navy says the sailors may have thought the small 
boat was there to help free the "cole" from lines tying it to the 
fuel dock. officials in yemen say they found bombmaking materials 
at a nearby apartment. fbi agents in yemen have taken swabs of explosive 
residue found in the apartment, and have sent them to washington for 
analysis.
