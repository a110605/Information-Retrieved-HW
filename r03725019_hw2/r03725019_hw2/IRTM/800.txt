texas officials have released a report on the december escape of seven 
dangerous inmates. state prison director gary johnson says the inmates 
used homemade weapons and tools to subdue a dozen guards and escape 
from the connally unit near kenedy, texas. the fugitives include convicted 
murderers, kidnappers, rapists and a child molester. they are believed 
to have killed an arlington, texas, police officer during a christmas 
eve robbery at a sporting goods store. today, the slain officer's 
mother confronted prison officials. i should hope that you would be 
terriblyably embarrassed. and rather than use the words fault and 
blame, use the words responsibility and accountability so that we 
can move forward to positive change. there's a great deal of difference 
in the energy, in the words, responsibility and accountability as 
opposed to fault and blame. so, i say, let's get accountable and responsible, 
honest, from the top to the bottom and move forward. the fugitives 
are still at large nearly a month after the escape, in spite of the 
most massive search in texas history.
