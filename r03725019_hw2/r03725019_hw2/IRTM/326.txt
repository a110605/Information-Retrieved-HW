The candidates in Sunday's election to restore civilian rule in the 
West African country of Ivory Coast. Gen. Robert Guei, 59: Ivory Coast's 
junta leader took power in a Dec. 24 coup. He initially said he wasn't 
interested in power, but has since traded his military uniform for 
a suit and tie to run as ``the people's candidate.'' A French-trained 
career soldier, he served as military chief from 1990 until 1995. 
A longtime nemesis of ousted President Henri Konan Bedie, he was removed 
from the military in the wake of unclear allegations that he tried 
to plan a 1995 coup. ___ Laurent Gbagbo, 55: Leader of the Ivorian 
Popular Front (FPI). A history professor, trade unionist and longtime 
opposition leader, he is the only political heavyweight opposing Guei 
in Sunday's election. He lost a run for the presidency in the country's 
first multiparty elections in 1990 and led a boycott of the 1995 poll, 
which he denounced as undemocratic. ___ Francis Wodie, 64: Leader 
of the Ivorian Worker's Party (PIT). A law professor and trade unionist, 
he is considered an intellectual without a strong national following. 
He was Bedie's only challenger in the 1995 election and later served 
as minister of higher education. ___ Theodore Mel Eg, 48: A former 
businessman and mayor of Abidjan's wealthy Cocody suburb. He was active 
for many years in the former ruling Democratic Party of Ivory Coast 
and is now running for the newly formed Democratic Union of Ivory 
Coast. ___ Nicolas Dioulo, 58: A retired UNESCO official, he is running 
as an independent candidate.
