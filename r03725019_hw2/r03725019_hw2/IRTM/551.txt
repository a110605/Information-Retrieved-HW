An explosion in the Saudi capital Friday afternoon killed two people, 
believed to be Americans, sources said. The Saudi sources said two 
people were killed when a bomb was tossed into their car window. The 
sources declined to be identified further. At the U.S. Embassy, spokesman 
Rick Roberts confirmed that there had been an explosion in the center 
of the city but said he had no information about what happened and 
was unsure whether Americans were involved. A Pakistani construction 
worker said the blast came at about 1 p.m. local time, right after 
Friday prayers. The man, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 
he saw an explosion in a four-wheel-drive vehicle. He said he saw 
two people who ``appeared to be Westerners'' and that one of the bodies 
had been cut in half by the blast. Security officials initially closed 
off two main thoroughfares in the commercial district where the blast 
took place and police were keeping people well away from the scene. 
Within a few hours, the streets were cleared and reopened and rain 
was rinsing the blood away. The attack comes a month after suspected 
suicide bombers blew a hole in the side of the USS Cole, killing 17 
American sailors as the ship refueled in Aden, Yemen, another Persian 
Gulf country. U.S. investigators have said the Oct. 12 attack on the 
Cole bears the earmarks of followers of Osama bin Laden, the exiled 
Saudi millionaire who officials say ordered the deadly 1998 bombings 
of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Bin Laden is hiding out in 
Afghanistan as the guest of its Islamic rulers, the Taliban. On June 
25, 1996, a truck bomb exploded outside the Khobar Towers housing 
complex near Dharan, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 U.S. Air Force personnel 
and injuring more than 500 Americans and Saudis. The previous year, 
on Nov. 13, a car bomb blew up at a U.S. military headquarters in 
Riyadh, killing five Americans.
