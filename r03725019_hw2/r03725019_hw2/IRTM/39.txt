Yugoslavia's highest court today invalidated parts of the recent presidential 
election. The move came after Opposition supporters forced police 
to back off from seizing a strikebound coal mine. The ruling was reported 
by the state news agency. It came in a case brought by the Opposition 
which claims Vojislov Kostunica should be declared winner of the election 
and President Slobodan Milosevic should acknowledge his defeat and 
leave office. Opposition leaders said today they feared the ruling 
would buy time for the Milosevic government to crack down on dissidence.
