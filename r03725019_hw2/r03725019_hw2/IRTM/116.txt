A popular uprising helped bring him to the Yugoslav presidency just 
a few days ago, but now Vojislav Kostunica faces the daunting challenge 
of solidifying power and ending the country's economic isolation. 
VOA correspondent Eve Cornard in Belgrade reports the European Union 
is expected to announce later today an easing of sanctions against 
Yugoslavia, now the former leader Slobodan Milosevic is out of office. 
Yugoslavia is awaiting word that sanctions that have strangled its 
economy might be partially lifted. European Union officials say a 
further lifting of sanctions is likely once Mr. Kostunica has a firm 
grip on power. But ousted leader Slobodan Milosevic says he plans 
to remain in Belgrade as a leader of the opposition to Mr. Kostunica, 
who says he has no plans to bow to Western pressure to extradite the 
former Yugoslav leader. Another test of Mr. Kostunica's political 
clout will be the meeting of Serbia's powerful Parliament on Monday, 
where supporters of Mr. Kostunica are expected to push for new election. 
The process of purging Milosevic supporters from key institutions 
and industries is underway. Kostunica supporters say the most important 
task now is to gain full control over Yugoslavia's police and security 
services, removing any trace of pro-Milosevic officials within the 
higher ranks, who could still be manipulated by him. Eve Cornard,
