Yemeni investigators found bomb-making equipment in a house near the 
port of Aden and believe two men who spent several days there are 
linked to the bombing of the USS Cole, security officials said Tuesday. 
The officials identified the men, who have disappeared, only as non-Yemeni 
Arabs. Other Yemeni officials said they were Saudi. The disclosure 
comes a day after Yemen reversed its earlier position and called the 
blast that killed 17 Americans ``a premeditated criminal act.'' The 
new stance gave a crucial boost to the investigation. The country's 
security forces interrogated dozens of port workers and others on 
Monday, including the head of the company that services U.S. warships. 
The security officials said the house was searched Monday and bomb-making 
materials were found. The officials did not elaborate on what the 
materials were. The officials said the men were believed to have entered 
Yemen four days before Thursday's bombing. They did not say which 
country the men had traveled from. There has been no credible claim 
of responsibility for the deadliest terrorist attack on the U.S. military 
since the 1996 bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia that 
killed 19. But immediate suspicion fell on terrorist mastermind Osama 
bin Laden _ accused in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania that killed 224 people. That August, the United States 
fired dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles on eastern Afghanistan in 
an attempt to kill bin Laden. In his first statement since December 
1998, bin Laden warned against another attack. He said Tuesday that 
an attack would not kill him and vowed to continue his battle against 
the ``enemies of Islam.'' He made no direct reference to the Yemen 
attack, but Afghanistan's Taliban rulers on Monday denied bin Laden 
was involved. MORE
