I'm Dave Deforest, VOA News. Tens of thousands of Serbs have taken 
to the streets of towns and cities throughout Yugoslavia to celebrate 
as President-elect Vojislav Kostunica prepares to take office. Outgoing 
President Slobodan Milosevic congratulated Mr. Kostunica in a Friday 
television appearance. We get the latest from VOA correspondent Eve 
Cornette in Belgrade. Slobodan Milosevic appeared on Serbian television 
to announce he had just received official information recognizing 
the electoral victory of Vojislav Kostunica. Mr. Milosevic said I 
believe this decision must be respected and for the first time describes 
the opposition leader as President-elect. But he said he would not 
ignore the support of those who did vote for him in election of September 
24th and would therefore lead his forces to become a strong opposition 
party, which he said would win convincingly in the next round of elections. 
Mr. Kostunica said he met with Mr. Milosevic and described the talks 
as positive because he said there was a lot of concern over the peaceful 
transfer of power. Yugoslavia's army chief congratulated Mr. Kostunica 
on his victory and assured television viewers the armed forces would 
support Yugoslavia's new leader. Eve Cornette, VOA News, Belgrade. 
President Clinton called Yugoslavia's popular uprising against Slobodan 
Milosevic as an extraordinary victory for the Serbian people. The 
People there have done an astonishing thing. This is just as big a 
blow for freedom as we saw when the Berlin Wall was torn down and 
when the Laquawensa led the shipyard workers in Poland, when the transformations 
occurred in all these other former communist countries. And it reverses 
a ten-year effort. It is an extraordinary day. Mr. Clinton pledged 
Friday that the United States and its allies would work together to 
lift sanctions to bring Yugoslavia out of isolation. The European 
community wants to lift sanctions as early as Monday.
