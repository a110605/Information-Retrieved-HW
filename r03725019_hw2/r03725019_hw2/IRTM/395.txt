I'm Dave Deforest, VOA News. Ivory Coast's newly elected President 
Loran Gbagbo plans to announce his government today, one day after 
being sworn in amid more deadly violence in the country. Mr Gbagbo 
has ruled out new elections but is promising to set up what he calls 
a broad-based government of national unity. New violence broke out 
Thursday between Gbagbo supporters and backers of rival opposition 
leader Alisan Ouattara, who was barred from Sunday's voting. The latest 
violence has killed 20 people. Some of the victims were burnt to death. 
A state of emergency and a nighttime curfew are in effect until Saturday. 
US State Department spokesman Philip Reicher called on the leaders 
of the various factions to insist that their supporters avoid violence. 
So they all have a fundamental responsibility to control their supporters 
and ensure that the violence doesn't spread and we are urging them 
to speak out, all the leaders, to speak out and urge their supporters 
to forsake violence. Philip Reicher.
