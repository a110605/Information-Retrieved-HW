Reports from Russia say there may be a presidential pardon in store 
for Edmund Pope, the American convicted yesterday in Moscow on spying 
charges. The head of Russia's Presidential Pardons Commission says 
the commission would recommend that President Vladimir Putin free 
Pope. The commission is expected to take up Pope's case tomorrow. 
A Moscow court sentenced Pope to 20 years in prison for allegedly 
trying to buy secret information about a high-speed Russian submarine. 
Pope maintains that he is innocent and says he should be released 
because he is suffering from a rare form of bone cancer.
