better news out of another trouble spot tonight -- in yugoslavia, 
the last remnants of former president milosevic's regime are falling 
away. even as protesters were turning violent outside the burned-out 
parliament building, demanding the resignation of milosevic's lieutenants, 
two did in fact resign, the prime minister and the country's most 
powerful police chief.
