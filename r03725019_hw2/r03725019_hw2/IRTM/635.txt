The White House says President Clinton will review all pending requests 
for executive clemency before he leaves office in January, including 
that of Leonard Peltier, the American Indian activist convicted of 
murdering two FBI agents in South Dakota. The president ``will focus 
on all of the clemency cases after the election and that will be one 
of them,'' White House spokesman Daniel Cruise said Sunday. Also Sunday, 
the White House released the transcript of Clinton's Nov. 7 interview 
with radio station WBAI-FM in New York City in which the president 
was asked about the Peltier case. Clinton said then that he would 
review all clemency applications ``and see what the merits dictate 
... based on the evidence.'' Asked specifically about Peltier, Clinton 
said he has ``never had time actually to sit down myself and review 
that case.'' ``I know it's very important to a lot of people, maybe 
on both sides of the issue,'' he said. ``And I think I owe it to them 
to give it an honest look-see.'' On June 26, 1975, FBI agents Ronald 
A. Williams and Jack R. Coler pursued a robbery suspect into the Pine 
Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. A shootout erupted with 
activists from the American Indian Movement. Two suspects were acquitted 
and a third freed for lack of evidence. Peltier, after fleeing to 
Canada and being extradited to the United States, was convicted and 
sentenced to consecutive life terms in 1977, despite defense claims 
that evidence against him had been falsified. Peltier, 56, is serving 
the terms at the U.S. Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kan. He has suffered 
from health problems in recent years. In June, a parole examiner recommended 
that Peltier's sentences be continued until his next full parole hearing 
in 2008. ___ Leonard Peltier Defense Committee http://www.freepeltier.org
