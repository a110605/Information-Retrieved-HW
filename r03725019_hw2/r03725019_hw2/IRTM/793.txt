Edmond Pope, convicted by Russia of spying but quickly pardoned, has 
a contract to write a book about the ordeal, his agent said Tuesday. 
Norman Brokaw, said Pope's memoir would be published by Little, Brown 
and Co. Terms of the deal and a publication date were not released. 
Pope, 54, a former naval officer and a businessman, was arrested on 
spy charges April 3 in Moscow. He was convicted Dec. 6 of buying plans 
for a high-speed Russian torpedo and sentenced to 20 years in prison. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin pardoned Pope before Christmas, citing 
his health problems and Russia's desire to maintain good relations 
with the United States.
