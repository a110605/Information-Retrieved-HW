in a simple, solemn ceremony on a sun-splashed day, the navy began 
to remember the fallen sailors of the "uss cole." when one is struck, 
we are all struck. and we join as a band of brothers and sisters. 
clutching american flags, often choking back tears, several hundred 
people gathered to commemorate the dead and to affirm they did not 
die in vain. this tragic event will not deter our service to our country. 
this strengthens our resolve and our commitment to our overseas presence 
and power. those sentiments, those emotions, were displayed last night, 
as well, when several thousand gathered at the norfolk waterfront 
in a candlelight vigil honoring the 17 sailors -- ages 19 to 35 -- 
many just starting their naval careers, some on their first tour of 
duty. all expecting to be home for christmas. today's ceremony, part 
of fleet week, marking the navy's anniversary, culminated in the unveiling 
of a statue, "the homecoming," a bronze celebration of what all sailors 
hope for. but on this day, also a reminder that -- the homecoming 
is not guaranteed, that those who put on our nation's uniform are 
always taking risks. tomorrow, another homecoming scheduled here, 
as some of the "cole's" injured return to their home port. today, 
however, was a tribute to those who will not. bob faw, nbc news, norfolk,
