abc's john m wethy. abc news has learned that the terrorists who attacked 
the "uss cole" originally planned to hit a different american warship 
in the same port ten months earlier. the attack was to be part of 
a worldwide effort during celebration of the millennium that included 
targets in jordan and seattle. intelligence sources say the target 
was to be a destroyer, the "uss the sullivans," which refueled in 
yemen's port of aden on january sources tell abc news that a suspect 
who has been in custody for several weeks told yemeni investigators 
that his group failed in their attack because their small boat, overloaded 
with explosives, sank just off the beach. the suspect said it took 
months to repackage and redesignwo the load of high explosives that 
was eventually used against "the cole." john m wethy, abc news, the
