In Moscow, the spy trial of an American businessman has been adjourned 
until Thursday. The adjournment came after defendant Edmund Pope suffered 
a serious bout of joint pain and was rushed to a prison clinic. The 
US embassy in Moscow has again asked that Mr. Pope be released on 
the grounds that he needs to be seen by an American doctor. He is 
accused of attempting to steal Russian torpedo technology.
