In Yugoslavia, the Democratic opposition will open a nation-wide campaign 
of civil disobedience today to back demands for President Slobodan 
Milosevic to step down. Meanwhile, a pair of Russian envoys has arrived 
in Belgrade to meet with Yugoslav government and opposition figures 
in an effort at mediation. More from Larry James in Moscow. The Russian 
Foreign Ministry announced Sunday that the two diplomats are now in 
Belgrade and plan to hold talks with the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry 
and prominent opposition politicians. Russia's special Balkan envoy 
Vladimir Chetsov is heading the delegation. On Saturday, Russian President 
Vladimir Putin had said, Russia was ready to play a more active role 
in the standoff between supporters of opposition candidate Vojislav 
Kostunica and President Slobodan Milosevic. Yugoslavia has not responded 
officially to that offer, but an opposition source had earlier said 
Belgrade rejected it. Earlier Sunday in Berlin, the German government 
said Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Russian President Putin had 
agreed that Yugoslavia's presidential election last week had showed 
the people voted for a democratic change. The statement followed a 
telephone conversation between the two on Saturday evening. Larry
