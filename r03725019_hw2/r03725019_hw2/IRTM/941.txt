at the aussie open, third seed venus williams struggled but managed 
to beat seed amelie mauresmo. venus, advancing to the quarters after 
a 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 win. the first set i was able it stay level. but after 
that, i was up and down. i think she was a little bit, too. i guess 
we weren't really sure about what we were going to do. i better walk 
out with a better game plan next time.
