thanks for joining us. allize on belgrade, yugoslavia. protesters 
demanding the resignation of president slobodan milosevic stormed 
the parliament building today. they took it over. riot police responded 
with tear gas in an effort to force the crowd back into the streets. 
the protesters say they have taken control of parliament, although 
it is not clear how many are actually inside the building. they are 
trying to force milosevic to accept the results of yugoslavia's election 
last month in which he was defeated. demonstrators are still making 
their way into belgrade by the thousands in spite of police roadblocks. 
president clinton says it may not be an appropriate case for u.s. 
military intervention, but the people of yugoslavia have spoken. and 
it's time for milosevic to go. the united states stands with people 
everywhere who are fighting for their freedom. we believe in democracy. 
i have said before, the opposition candidate who, according to all 
unbiased reports, clearly won the election, obviously also has strong 
differences with us. this is not a question of whether he agrees with 
us. all we want for the serbian people is what we want for people 
everywhere, the right to freelly choose their own leaders. this is 
the parliament building in belgrade. clearly, fires are burning there, 
inside and out. there are also reports from our bureau chief alessio 
vinci in belgrade that the state-run tv building is being occupied 
by protesters. the situation is changing rapidly.
