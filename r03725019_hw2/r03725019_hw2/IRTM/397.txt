A Russian scientist has told a Moscow City court that the information 
an American businessman allegedly tried to purchase about a Russian 
torpedo is commonly available and not a state secret. The scientist, 
an expert on the torpedo and a defense witness at the trial of businessman 
Edmund Pope said he had often used the torpedo information for his 
research and had spoken openly about it. A defense lawyer said the 
testimony would help his client.
