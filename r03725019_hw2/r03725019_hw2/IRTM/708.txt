when you are leaving the highest naufs the land, there are a lot of 
things you can do. as president clinton's term comes to an end, h 
is considering presidential pardons from high-profile prisoners. one 
in particular has f.b.i. agents outraged. for the normally reserved 
f.b.i., a rare public display. 500 current and retired agents silently 
marches around the white house at midday. the turnout demonstrating 
the f.b.i.'s intense opposition for clemency for lennard petier, kills 
f.b.i. agent. federal investigators maintain two agents were wounded 
and shot at close range as they cried out for help. he walked up to 
them as they were wounded and put bullets in their head. we don't 
think that should be forgiven with the passage of time. ballistics 
evidence failed to connect him to the crime. it is frightening when 
i see government, armed officials marching through the streets of 
our capital to convince a civilian president not to correct the civil 
rights abuses they have committed. president l president clinton faces 
some tough choices in other high profile and croifl cases. michael 
milk en, the high-flying wall street trader. susan mcduge gal, the 
whitewater figure who spent two years in jail for refusing to answer 
questions from kenneth starrr. and web hubble, the justice department 
official. and for jonathan poll lard, the former navy analyst convicted 
of spying for israel. bill clinton, who has used the pardon power 
less than any president since nixon, will be generous in his a last 
days in office.
