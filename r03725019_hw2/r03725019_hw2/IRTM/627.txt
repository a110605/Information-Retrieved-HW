The Voice of America presents differing points of view on a wide variety 
of issues. Next, an editorial expressing the policies of the United 
States government. The years of animosity are past. That was President 
Bill Clinton's message to the people of Vietnam during his recent 
visit. "Today we have a shared interest in your prosperity", said 
Mr. Clinton. "We have a stake in your future and we wish to be your 
partners. We wish you success". President Clinton's visit represents 
a watershed in US-Vietnam relations. In the 1960's and early 1970's, 
the US fought a protracted war, aimed at preventing South Vietnam 
from being absorbed by communist North Vietnam. Some 58,000 Americans 
died in this effort which ultimately proved unsuccessful. In addition 
to those killed in Vietnam, many other Americans were held as prisoners 
of war or listed as missing in action. Improvement in US-Vietnam relations 
has depended on progress in accounting for those Americans listed 
as missing. Based on such progress, the US in 1994 lifted its trade 
embargo on Vietnam. A year later the US and Vietnam established normal 
diplomatic relations. The value of open markets and respect for human 
rights were the principle themes of President Clinton's talks with 
the Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary Lay Kaffu and others, 
including Roman Catholic Archbishop Joan Baptist Fa Mei Man. Mr. Clinton 
recognized the progress that Vietnam has made in some areas. But he 
said that greater openness and greater freedom would speed the country's 
development. Vietnam has taken steps to open its economy and trade 
with the US has grown as a result. An agreement signed in September 
is expected to expand trade further. But success will depend on the 
extent to which Vietnam embraces entrepreneurship, innovation and 
competition. "We have a bright future", said President Clinton, "that 
we can build together to liberate our people and their potential".
